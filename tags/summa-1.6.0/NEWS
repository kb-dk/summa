========================
2010-06-07: Summa 1.6.0
========================

 * Upgrade Lucene to version 3.0.1.

 * Feature: Added lowercase analyzer, see SummaLowercaseAnalyzer

 * Moved progress.xml to root of persistent directory.

 * Known bug: Supplied data to Summix isn't working.

========================
2010-05-25: Summa 1.5.5
========================

 * NOTE: This is last Summa release with Lucene 2.4.

 * Updated H2 to 1.2.132.

 * Feature: Added ARC file reading support.

 * Feature: Added configuration 
   'summa.support.didyoumean.closeonnonexistingindex', when set to true, 
	 which is the default value, DidYouMeanSearchNode#managedOpen logs a 
   fatal error and throws an RemoteException, if the didyoumean index 
   doesn't exists.

 * Feature: It is now possible to query getModifiedRecords for just
   id, base etc. and get these faster. This is due to an added feature 
   in QueryOptions, which allow specification of which attributes there
   should be returned.

 * Feature: added support for getting multiple records in one go.
 	 Sample can be found in:
	 Web/src/dk/statsbiblioteket/summa/web/services/GetRecordsResponseSample.xml
	 Schema can be found in:
	 Web/src/dk/statsbiblioteket/summa/web/services/GetRecordsResponse.xsd.

 * Feature: Made unicode / UTF-8 sanitiser to handle non-controlled 
   input such as web content 'SanitiseUnicodeFilter', this filter handle 
   meta data as well as  content and streams.

 * Feature: Added snippet extrator filter Snippetfilter.

 * Feature: RecordShaperFilter can now copy meta data from Payload
   to Record.
   Extended RecordShaperFilter with optional md5 summing of id when 
   the ID is more than a given length.

 * Feature: Extended TikaFilter to handle input as both Payload
   Stream and Record.content.

 * Feature: Added nearly conforming parser for danMARC2 Linjeformat.
   NOTE: Special charecters not mapped directly to Unicode are ignored.

 * Feature: Added option for specifying input charset and subfield
   divider for Aleph2XML.

 * Feature: Support for granularity and ignore-changes-newer-than
   for rss feed on status page.

 * Feature: In the test interface, it is now possible to turn
   didyoumean search on/off. It is off by default, and is turned on
   by a checkbox.

 * Bugfix: The XMLSplitterHandler double-encoded CDATA-blocks.

 * Bugfix: Fix to Bug #9 on tracker. Updated Configuration class to use
   SubConfiguraionNotSupportedException, when sub configurations is not
   supported.

 * Bugfix: Sorting of the characters 'aa', which are Collator-wise
   treated as 'å' in danish, was inconsistent and resulted in
   unnecessary rebuilding of facet structures with sortLocale "da".

 * Bugfix: Changed setting 'summa.support.didyoumen.location' to 
 	 'summa.support.didyoumean.location'.

 * Bugfix: Updated UpdateFromFulldumpFilter to only get Id and base
   from records. This is faster over RMI.

 * Bugfix: When receiving an NoSuchElementException in
   StorageReaderClient over RMI, it is packed inside a RemoteException.
   This is now checked when recieving an RemoteException over RMI.
	 Fixed bug in AggregatingStorage where MergingContext should use a 
   variable from IteratorContext but redeclared it.

 * Performance: Added option to skip "expunge deleted" for the 
   LuceneManipulator.

========================
2010-03-24: Summa 1.5.4
========================
 
 * Feature: Did-You-Mean service built index on start-up, iff index 
   is not already present. Searching while building index results in 
   an empty search response.
   Added DidYouMean support to the sample website.

 * NOTICE: Did-You-Mean static root for index is renamed to 'index' 
   since the index created by FSDirectory is by default placed in
   the directory 'didyoumean'.

 * NOTICE: didyoumean.xml config file, uses a RAMDirectory as standard.
   Should be changed to FSDirectory if using large indexes to generate 
   the Did-You-Mean index.
	  
 * Feature: Added merge method to merge responses to Did-You-Mean
   service.

 * Feature: Added Did-You-Mean search tool. Found in
   'didyoumean-tool.sh' or 'didyoumean-tool.bat'.

 * Feature: Status and Sample website now shows version number and
   revision tag. This fixes #78 in tracker.

 * Bugfix: Updated SearchWS so it now returns valid XML, when an
   error occur in creation of a search response. See schema 
   'SearchErrorResponse.xsd' for details.

 * Bugfix: Sample and status websites are updated to XHTML 1.0.   

 * Bugfix: in PriorityQueue.

 * Cleanup in ant targets.
   - ant jars - which builds all jar/war files and creates 
                '/dist/summa-test-$version.zip', with all jars 
                and wars, along with a summix.
	              This is done in approximately 20 seconds on ssd.
   - ant release - builds a full release zip in /dist.
                This takes approximately 105 seconds on ssd.
   Furthermore each module has the possibility to make a 'jar' or 
   'release'.
 
========================
2010-03-11: Summa 1.5.3
========================

 * NOTICE: The didYouMean web services is only experimetal. API and 
    configuration keys may still change.

 * Added UpdateFromFulldumpFilter which from a fulldump treat the dump
 	  as an update on a single base. This means:
	  - updating changed records.
	  - delete non-existing records.
	  - records that hasn't changed are ignored.

 * Feature: Added Did-You-Mean support for FSDirectory as well as
	  RAMDirectory. This is a configuration.
		Feature: Added didyoumean tool to Samples/
    Updated Did-You-Mean example response xml and schema.

 * Feature: Added junit test functionality to all ant files, which
	  include generating xml and html files for showing result of junit
	  tests on a single webpage.
	  NOTE: The control module, is not working at this point.

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger threw an Exception logging
	  errors for multi volume.

 * Bugfix: The DatabaseStorage made a single commit at the end of
	  base delete. In the current version of h2, this commit required a
	  very large amount of memory (½GB+ for 400K records). This has
	  been changed to commit every 500 records, which has very little
	  memory overhead.

 * Bugfix: Fixed ticket #31, now RecordUtil.toXML doesn't show the
	  underlying XML framework to API.
	  
 * Bugfix: Added teardown method, to stop storage and close connections.


========================
2010-02-19: Summa 1.5.2
========================
 
 * NOTICE: The didYouMean web services is only experimetal. API and 
    configuration keys may still change.

 * Bugfix: Updated status page, so it present a valid html site. 

 * Bugfix: Added LuceneIndexDescriptor.xsd schema

 * Bugfix: Updated sample xml response, to be consisted in naming
 	 	with schemas

 * Bugfix: Storage.batchJob() would
		set the 'last' variable in the batch job whenever the job crossed
	  a page boundary while iterating over the selected records for the
	  batch job

 * Feature: Expose a didYouMean webservice under the standard SearchWS. 
    Web service can return more than one result, this is configurable 
    at query time, defaulting to 1.
		Import Lucene didyoumean libs from
	  			 http://github.com/mkamstrup/lucene-didyoumean/downloads

 * Feature: Sleep time in 
    Workflow/src/dk/statsbiblioteket/summa/workflow/WaitForStatusStep.java
    is now configurable.

 * Feature: Implement a 'batchjob' command for storage-tool.sh

 * Release includes all xsd schemas for xml responses found in /doc/schema/

========================
2010-02-05: Summa 1.5.1
========================

 * Bugfix: Proper escaping of messages from sub-services in the status web
           service. The status web service would return invalid XML if any
           of the monitored services returned properties with names that
           was not valid XML.

========================
2010-01-27: Summa 1.5.00
========================
	  
 * NOTICE: Convert entire Summa source tree to Apache 2 license

 * Storage ABI break (source compatibility preserved): Add variants
	  of flush() and flushAll() that takes an extra QueryOptions
	  parameter.

 * ABI break: Add setter methods for QueryOptions.meta(). We alreay
	  broke the Storage binary protocol so it's no biggie.

 * Update H2 dep. to 1.2.126, which among other fixes includes: "The
	  database is now closed after an out of memory exception, because
	  the database could get corrupt otherwise.". and disable the H2 
    level 2 cache by default for SuggestStorageH2.

 * New API Storage.batchJob for running predefined batch jobs in any 
 	  scripting language accrose of subsets of the storage.
	  Bundled sample batch jobs with Summix: 
		collect_ids.job.js, delete.job.js, and count.job.js 
 
 * Add a 'holdings' command to storage-tool

 * Add a __holdings__ record to storage containing detailed storage 
 	  statistic. Show storage __holdings__ in status page and feed
	  The holdings can also be looked up with the "holdings" action in
	  storage-tool.sh

 * Define a meta flag "TRY_UPDATE", which alter default behaviour of 
    Storage.flush() and Storage.flushAll() to not update records if they 
		already are up to date.
	
 * New boolean property on RecordWriter:
	  "summa.storage.recordwriter.tryupdate" to pass TRY_UPDATE=true in
	  the QueryOptions to flushAll()

 * Bugfix: Allow both old and new H2 file formats in H2Storage and
	  SuggestStorageH2 (ie. allow both .data.db and .h2.db)

 * Bugfix: There was an elusive deadlock in QueuedInputStream used
	  by the ZipParser class. It both involved a missing 'synchronized'
	  statement and a bad cast of byte to int. We have replaced the
	  entire implementation with Java's native Piped{In,Out}putStream.

 * Bugfix: The result of an IndexLookup was scrabled when a
	  sortLocale was defined for the facet

 * Bugfix: The FacetResults did not perform entity escaping
	  correctly

 * Bugfix: UniqueTimestampGenerator.MAX_TIME was not constructed
	  correctly and was in fact negative!

 * Bugfix: LuceneManipulator kept running in the event of out of
	  disk space

 * BugFix: Tag-representations were double entity-encoded

 * Bugfix: The SortedPoolImpl was not thread-safe for reads

 * BugFix: Sort failed with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if
	  certain documents did not contain a term for the sort field

 * Bugfix: The sample website did not support sorted search or
	  paging

 * Bugfix: The MultipassSortcomparator works now, but used the
	  memory-inefficient BitsArrayInts
	  Testing: A bug has been discovered in BitsArrayPacked, where
	  assigning to a value nullifies the subsequent value

 * Feature: Made the LuceneManipulator optionally multi threaded
	  (deafult is 1 thread, which mimicks the old behaviour). As par of
	  this, the IndexManipulator-interface was extended with support
	  for signalling if the order of documents gets unreliable

 * Feature: Added filter for post-processing in ingest workflows
	  involving full dumps. The primary usage is clearing of old data
	  from Storage

 * Feature: Provided an option for enabling lenient marc-parsing in
	  ISO2709ToMARCXMLFilter

 * Feature: Made it possible to specify the sort comparators used by
	  a LuceneSearchNode, making it possible to choose between memory
	  usage and speed when sorting fields with many terms. Still in the
	  experimental phase

 * Make StorageRunner.main(), SummaSearcherRunner.main(), and
	  FilterControl.main() do a System.exit(1) if they encounter a fatal 
		top level exception

 * Use 'set -e' in all Summix .sh script to have them bail out on
	  any uncaught errors

 * Make all Summix .sh shell scripts use 'exec' when launching their
	  primary child process. This way we don't litter 3 processes for
	  each service - we have one process/service and that is that of
	  the JVM.

 * Logging for Summix: Services now log to log/<service-type>.log
	  and log/<service-type>.fatal.log. All *-tool.sh log to
	  log/tools.log. Here <service-type> is derived from the basename of
		the config file

========================
2009-12-02: Summa 1.4.15
========================

 * Bump SB Util dependency to 0.4.8. This enables some fixes in our collator
   based sorts as well as some more aggresive fast pathing of XSLT processing
   when namespaces are ignored (SB)

 * Include "Most popular queries the last 24 hours" in the status page and
   rss feed (SB)

 * Implemented PipedStream: A bridge from OutputStream to InputStream
   with buffering and callback

 * Bugfix/logging: Make sure we always store the last 5 fatal.log (or error.log)
                  files (we used to only store 2)

 * Remove all attic code as agreed with Toke. To dig out the attic code from
   svn it is probably easiest to do:

     svn co https://summa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/summa/tags/summa-1.4.14

 * The status web service now exposes a xml.jsp, index.jsp, and rss.jsp. All
   fully working (however with minimal content for now).
   The RSS feed will be marked as updated if any one of the following
   conditions hold:
	  - There is an error anywhere
	  - The storage/index has been been updated since last check

 * New helper classes in Web module to help build RSS feeds

 * Made the ID-delimiter configurable in Aleph2XML

 * Bugfix: Changed all usages of Collator to (optionally where appropriate)
           consider space a char that goes before any other chars (SB)

 * Bugfix: Disable the level 2 cache in the H2Storage by default. Some memory
           balloning has been experienced with the L2 cache enabled (SB)

 * Bugfix: The status webservice did not allow duplicate keys in a group.
           This made queryCount reporting throw away queries with the same
           count. Rant: Why is there no SortedList class in Java!? (SB)

========================
2009-11-23: Summa 1.4.14
========================

 * IMPORTANT: Updated core storage database libs. H2 upgraded from 1.1.118
   to 1.2.124. This brings along a new optimized db storage format that gives
   better disk usage and faster queries.
   In order to use the new storage format you need to completely rebuild your
   storage - by deleting all the old storage files. Summa continues to work
   with the old storage files, but you will not benefit from the newest
   enhancements.

 * New exception policy: When any service encounters an uncaught exception in
   a thread it will be treated as a fatal error and the JVM will exit leaving
   fatal errors in the log and on stderr.

 * Bugfix: Fix a very elusive bug where the storage would corrupt its internal
           indexes. The only symptom was that one could no longer retrieve
           batches of records with the getRecordsModifiedAfter() method.
           It would always return an empty iterator.
           This bug was very hard to reproduce except on some specific hardware
           and operating systems. Nonetheless it was there.

 * Bugfix: Fix NullPointerException when running a filter chain that was closed
           without ever having received any payloads.

========================
2009-11-18: Summa 1.4.13
========================

 * Optimization: Storage.clearBase() would at times require big memory
                 allocations. This has been partly remedied. The execution
                 speed of this function should also have improved somewhat.

 * Add a new filter MachineStatsFilter logging stats about the JVM. This is
   enabled by default in the Summix indexer and ingester

 * Log JVM stats from StorageRunner and SummaSearcherRunner. This means that
   Storage and Searcher services in Summix will log stats by default

 * Enable the log4j CleanSlateRollingFileAppender appender in the Summix
   log4j config.

 * Error handling: Major reworking of RMI wrapper classes to handle
	               Errors by sending alerts and shutting down. Note that we
	               are talking Errors and not normal Exceptions

 * Bugfix: Calling close() on ZIPParser before EOF left the
           ZIP-thread hanging

 * Bugfix: Fixed racing deadlock problem in ZIPParser

 * Bugfix: There was a chance that the ThreadedStreamParser did not
           terminate properly when close on sourcePayload failed

========================
2009-11-03: Summa 1.4.12
========================

 * Critical bugfix: When clearing a base via ClearBaseFilter or any other means,
                    the H2Storage module (the default) had a race condition
                    causing a risk of the database indexes would be corrupted.

 * New web service StatusWS. Can collect a very simple status report from
   the storage-, searcher-, and suggest services. We plan to expand this
   functionality in the future. Especially more detailed status from each
   service and the ability to get the status as an RSS feed

 * Optimized the special case of a standard search where the number of wanted
   records is 0. The use case here is asking for a hit count on a given query,
   without needing the records

 * Less verbose logging from MARCParser

 * Changed the default timeout for ZIP to Integer.MAX_VALUE, as ZIP-files
   containing very large files can take a lot of time to process

 * Major cleanup of ThreadedStreamParser, reducing formerly complex logic to
   clearly defined and consistent workflow

 * Added the inverse equivalent to ContentToStreamFilter, namely a
   StreamToContentFilter - creating a Record payload from a stream payload
   with the record content set to the contents of the stream

 * Bugfix: The clearBase() method on DerbyStorage didn't work

 * Bugfix: The PayloadQueue did not add the size of parents and
           children to the size for a Record

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger had a one-off error that was
           triggered by XML without linebreaks between tags

 * Bugfix: Changed build to include dtd and ent for XHTML entity
           resolver

========================
2009-10-22: Summa 1.4.11
========================
 
 * WARNING: Another DB schema change for the suggest service
 
 * WARNING: ABI break for FacetResultExternal. This will require you to run
            the same version of Summa on your web services as your Summa
            search engine

 * New API for the suggest web service; getRecentSuggestions. Used to
   retrieve the last N suggestions updated within the last X seconds.
   
 * New API for the search web service; filterSearchSorted. Used to pass
   in an extra filter-query that will not affect the ranking of the "real"
   query. This is useful
 
 * The default Suggest engine backend (SuggestStorageH2) now features a 
   "query sanitizer" (which is a configurable class of Lucene Analyzer
   controlled by the property summa.support.suggest.sanitizer) that will be
   run over user queries to be added to the DB. The default is a 
   Lucene WhitespaceAnalyzer which will result in the fix for the bug
   mentioned below (bug #61)
 
 * A new RollingFileAppender for Log4J that rolls the logs each time the
   application starts. Set the class attribute of the appender element
   in your log4j.xml to
   dk.statsbiblioteket.summa.common.util.CleanSlateRollingFileAppender
 
 * Bump SBUtil to 0.4.7. This should improve performance on some XSLT operations
 
 * Bugfix: The merging of Facet results from different searcher
           setups failed when the facets weren't the same
   
 * Bugfix: Fix #59: The XMLSplitterHandler did not handle multiple default
           name spaces properly
 
 * Bugfix: Patch from Jens Henrik Jensen (SB) to fix some issues
           with the client-shell.sh, control-shell, and control.sh scripts:
            - Set the script mode to always exit on errors
            - Be runnable disregarding the working dir
            - To not call popd as last function in the script,
              overriding the exit value of command

 * Bugfix: ReaderInputstream did not close th encapsulated
           Inputstream upon close
 
 * Bugfix: The toXML-method in RecordUtil performen an endless
           recursion when parent-child-relations were double-linked

 * Bugfix: Fix bug #63: "Suggestions with same normalized key show
           same hitcount"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix bug #61: "Whitespace garbage in suggest strings"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix bug #65: "ZipException: invalid bit length repeat; during
           ingest". The trick is to ensure that all operations on the
           ZipInputStream happen in the same thread. This is achieved by
           implementing a QueuedInputStream that holds an internal blocking
           queue all data is pushed over. There's a lot of room for
           optimization here, see the fixme in the header for QueuedInputStream
 
========================
2009-09-14: Summa 1.4.10
========================

 * The RecordWriter filter, responsible for inserting Records into Storage,
   now has a memory cap for its internal queue that can be set via the
   summa.storage.recordwriter.batchmaxmemory property. Huge Records could cause
   freak OOMs on the Storage

 * New deployment mechanism LocalDeployer that can be used to bypass the need
   for an SSH session when deploying+starting a client on a local machine.
   Pass '-t local' to the 'deploy' command when deploying a client from
   the control-shell

 * A lot of work on the Suggest service - particularly some serious
   performance issues should have been ironed out

    - Compare strings by normalizing them with a Lucene analyzer,
      using SummaKeywordAnalyzer by default

    - The property summa.support.suggest.lowercasequeries has been renamed to
	  summa.support.suggest.normalizequeries since we can do more advanced
	  transformations now (see point above)

    - Introduces max rows setting to h2 backend for suggest, ensuring
      lower response times for parts of a large result set (for example single
      character prefixes)

    - Make import for suggest drop and re-create indexes,
	  greatly improving import performance

	- Add a new search key to fetch the most recently updated sugegstions.
	  Pass in summa.support.suggest.recent to test this out. It is also
	  supported in suggest-tool.sh shipped in Summix

 * WARNING: The afore mentioned work on the Suggest service has broken the
   database layout of the default backend SuggestStorageH2. You will need to
   export your old data and import it in a new empty suggest instance

 * search-tool.sh will now echo the search response time in ms (also applies
   to suggest-tool.sh)

 * Created ContentToStreamFilter to wrap content from Record into a
    Stream on Payload

 * Made the XMLSplitter optionally namespace-aware with regard to
   record specification

 * Bugfix: The RecordWriter needed to run with debug logging enabled
           in order to run at oeak performance

 * Bugfix: The StreamingDocumentCreator filter that is responsible for creating
           Lucene documents could raise StackOverflowErrors on huge
           SummaDocuments. This was caused by a misuse of recursion inside the
           XMLStreamReader shipped with Java, see:
	       http://sbdevel.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/an-excursion-in-java-recursion/

 * Bugfix: ScriptFilter did not resolve the script engine correctly when
           sniffing only on the script extension.

=======================
2009-09-01: Summa 1.4.9
=======================

 * The ClearBaseFilter can now select to clear the configured base only
   if the incoming payload matches a criteria in the same that a RegexFilter
   matches Payloads+Records (SB)

 * Make the default Storage backend (H2Storage) perform an analyze
   every 100000 records on flushAll, and skip the corresponding analysis
   on startup. This should improve boot times on big databases considerably (SB) 

 * Added clear/import/export commands to the Suggest service. Also supported
   by the command line tool 'suggest-tool.sh' (SB)

 * Enable the H2 second level LRU page cache by default. This should speed up
   large bases, but might be a small hit for smaller bases. This feature
   can be controlled via the summa.storage.database.l2cache boolean property

 * when specifying a static root for SummasearcherImpl, it will now be
   expanded with Resolver.getPersistentFile instead of being used directly

 * Bugfix: Make sure that the database indexes are used in the H2 Suggest
           backend (SB)

 * Bugfix: Log uncaught exceptions in the RecordBatcher thread in
           the RecordWriter filter (SB)

 * Bugfix: In DatabaseStorage explicitly rollback connections with
           any errors detected (the rollbacks where implicit from closing
           the connection before - this is not good JDBC behaviour) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Bundle Tool should escape property refs inside <jvmArg>
           tags (SB)

 * Bugfix: Fix db connection leak in flushAll() when we fail to set
         the connection in write-mode. This is categorized as a
         corner-case bug, but a bug nonetheless (SB)

 * Bugfix: Added check for endless recursion in H2Storage.touchParent

=======================
2009-08-18: Summa 1.4.8
=======================

 * Added setting for filters in FilterSequence to control whether the filter
   is enabled or not. Set the property "filter.enabled" to true or false to
   control this

 * New new filter called TikaDocumentCreator that creates Lucene documents
   directly from Tika XHTML events. This bypasses the needs for XSLT processing
   and can provide big performance gains where raw Tika processing is applicable

 * New filters RecordShaperFilter and DocumentShaperFilter for restructuring and'
   handling record metadata and Lucene document fields (respectively) in the
   filter pipeline

 * XMLSplitterFilter supports splitting streams into Records without
   extracting IDs. This is useful in conjunction with the new RecordShaperFilter

 * Bump SBUtil dependency to 0.4.6

 * Introduce experimental API to do super fast alphabetical index listings via the
   facet browser. See dk.statsbiblioteket.summa.facetbrowser.api.IndexKeys for
   a starting point

 * Bugfix: Automagically free all RMI services registered via the
           RemoteHelper when the JVM exits (this means pertty much all RMI
           services). This should fix some bugs where the services refused
           to come back up when started from a ClientShell, but killed with
           'kill <pid>' from a Unix shell. The problem was that Java doesn't
           do this clean up by default - go figure

 * Bugfix: Don't resolve DTDs in the XMLSplitter{Parser,Handler,Filter}

 * Bugfix: Fix https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/summa/ticket/41 - 
           "Search-time boosts in the IndexDescriptor are not used"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/summa/ticket/28 -
          "DatabaseStorage.clearBase() doesn't update record mtimes"

=======================
2009-06-26: Summa 1.4.7
=======================

 * Critical bugfix: The ThreadedStreamParser class, which is the base class for
                    many of the core filters, could drop payloads when the
                    internal queue was overflowed

=======================
2009-06-23: Summa 1.4.6
=======================

 * New default: The storage web service will longer XML-escape the embedded
   record contents. To control this behavior set the property
   summa.common.recordutil.escapecontent to true or false (SB)

 * Include a RegexFilter that can black- or white list Payloads based on
   regex matching on their, id, base, and/or content (SB)

 * Add a new backend for the ThreadedStreamParser filter, called ZIPParser.
   This can be used as a filter for extracting Payloads from a zip stream (SB)

 * Changed the threadedStreamParser to use PayloadQueue which allows for
   limit on queue-size based on memory usage

 * Enhanced Suggest to allow for switching between case-sensitive and
   case-insensitive operation (SB)

 * Added listSuggestions and addSuggestions to Suggest to prepare for
   export and import of bulk lists of suggestions (SB)

 * Experimental: Extraction and merging of Lucene index term statistics. This
   is intended to be used in the upcoming "distributed ranking on a
   sharded index" (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: The threadedStreamParser did not close Payloads on
           exceptions (Refind)

 * Bugfix: The PayloadQueue failed when queueing Payloads without Records
           with a fixed ceiling on memory usage (SB)

 * Bugfix: The H2 suggest storage did not store queryCount for
           new suggestions (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't hardcode port 27000 and remote console in the DeployCommand
           on ControlShell

=======================
2009-06-04: Summa 1.4.5
=======================

 * Bump SBUtil dependency to 0.4.5 (SB)

 * Bump internal Derby dep. to the new 10.5.1.1 hotness. This brings in
   client side paging via LIMIT/FETCH clauses which has been much awaited (SB)

 * Add a TikaFilter that extracts metadata from crawled files and converts them
   to an intermediate XHTML structure. This can be used as the base for a
   hard disk indexer (SB)

 * A new filter, ReplaceFilter, that can replace substrings in Records or
   streams (Refind)

 * New filter, StdOutFilter, that drops Records (or optionally only their
   content) to stdout (Refind)

 * Added optional forceConsolidateOnClose to the IndexController (SB)

 * Include a ScriptService service class that launches an inlined or external
   script (anything supported by Java's ScriptEngine API) wrapped behind
   a Service interface (SB)

 * Inject a 'log' variable into ScriptFilter that can be used to access the
   common-logging logger of the filter (SB)

 * Make clearTagsOnConsolidate default to true as it speeds up facet building
   tremendously for larger indexes (SB)

 * Bugfix: It was not possible to dertermine the payload ids of failed payloads
           from ObjectFilterImpls (which means most filters) when the process
           threw a non-Exception throwable. These cases are now logged very
           verbosely because they often hide very nasty bugs (OOM etc) (SB)

 * Bugfix: The maxTags in the FacetScructure configuration was used
           as wantedTags when doing faceting, resulting in 200 tags/facet
           for the default setup (SB)

 * Bugix: Exceptions from FilterControl, SummaSearcherRunner, and
          StorageRunner's main() methods could be dropped. Install
          uncaught exception handlers that logs any top level exceptions (SB)

 * Bugfix: RecordUtil.toXML() did not close <element> tags in the
           <meta> section (Refind)

 * Bugfix: The {Memory,Disk}Pools did not accept adds with position
           above their size (SB)

 * Bugfix: DerbyStorage works again now (and is probably a lot faster than
           before, but this is yet to be tested) (SB)

=======================
2009-05-19: Summa 1.4.4
=======================

 * Critical Bugfix: The web services leaked connections to search, suggest
                    and storage

 * Ported a Lucene sorter that uses cached collator and
   index-based sorting from Stable Summa to head. This should
   provide a speed-increase for sorted searches along with less
   memory consumption (thill not ideal though. For that we need to
   hack the faceting system)

 * The Javascript configuration backend, JStorage, is now marked as stable,
   although it has not seen extensive real-world tests

 * Lots of polish to the client/control shells:

    - Don't print debug messages by default in the shell

    - Print the correct Summa version number when starting a
	  shell instead of some outdated CVS-mumbo-jumbo

	- Make the shell Core exit when the input stream is closed.
	  This way one can pipe commands into the shell with standard unix
	  pipes as well as exit the shell with Ctrl-d

	- Allow fetching status of deployed services from the
	  Control shell. Just pass clientId/serviceId to the status command

	- Add command to list services deployed on a client directly from
	  the Control shell, optionally printing the status of each service

	- Add a -f/--format switch to 'services' and 'status' commands on client-
	  and control shells. With this switch enabled they print out in a canonical
	  machine parseable format

	- Add -w and --wait to the 'start' command in the Client
	  shell and implement a 'wait' command as well

	- Add a -b and --bundle switch to the 'services' command
	  in client- and control shells

 * Make it configurable whether the Client keeps old services in the
   artifacts/ dir after it has removed a service. The relevant
   property is summa.control.client.storeartifacts

 * Make it possible to install clients under another base path than
   ~/summa-control. The easiest way to achieve this is by setting
   the summa.control.client.basepath property on the control server.
   This is useful if one wants to completely separate the client and
   service data from the control/repo/bundle data.

 * Bugfix: Made MoreLikeThis case sensitive for results but kept it
           case-insensitive for query. This closes bug #1659

 * Bugfix: Under certaing circumstances an empty Tag could be added in the
           facetting system

 * Bugfix: In FilterService fix possible NPE in stop() if the
           internal FilterControl fails to instantiate

 * Bugfix: The FacetBrowser did not sort Tags correctly for facets
           with one field or with less tags than the requested maximum

 * Buildfix: Enable compilation of the Web module in the global .jar target

 * Bugfix: The LuceneSearchNode returned one hit more than requested

 * Bugfix: Don't set the state to 'running' when the StorageService
           has completed statup, but use the 'idle' state (as everything
           else also does) instead

=======================
2009-05-11: Summa 1.4.3
=======================

 * Introduced a DescriptorManipulator that ensures that a copy of the
   IndexDescriptor-XML is stored in the index-folder (SB)

 * Make the search nodes (notably LuceneSearchNode and FacetSearchNode)
   capable of fetching IndexDescriptor from the index-folder. This is used
   in conjuction with the indexer copying the index descriptor over to the
   index folder on commit and consolidates.
   With this in place the searcher should be able to react on changing index
   descriptors without restarting the searcher (SB)

 * Sort commands alphabetically when listing commands inside a shell (SB)

 * Add a 'stop' command to the control-shell which can be used to stop
   a client instance (SB)

 * Factor out a ClientConnectionFactory that can be used to instantiate
   ClientConnections via a ControlConnection (SB)

 * Bring back field based sorting of search results. This is just a prelimary
   of what will come. Correct collator based sorting is not supported yet, but
   is slated for Summa 1.4.4. On the very long run we are designing a highly
   optimized sorting mechanism based on the facetting framework (SB)

 * You can now prepend queries with a boost() parameter to control query time
   boosting. The format i boost(<<field|group>^<float>> [...]). Fx boosting
   all hits in the 'ti' group by 0.1 and all hits in the 'au' field by 10:
   boost(ti^0.1 au^10) (SB)

 * You can now prefix queries with '<:explain:>' and the response from the
   search engine will contain the details of the ranking calculation. This
   is very handy for tweaking the ranking algorith by adjusting boosts in the
   IndexDescriptor or in-query (Refind)

 * Strip boosts from the documents in the legacy XSLT, they where not applied
   correctly (SB)

 * Bugfix: The wrong initializer for SummaQueryParser was used, so
	       it was not possible to specify query time boosts (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly unexport remote interfaces when we kill a Client
	       with the 'kill' command from the client-shell. Not doing this
	       caused some wierd RMI hangs and "connection refused" messages (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly shut doen client and any services when Client
           receives a stop() command (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly detect if someone wipes the bundle repo under a
           running ControlCore (SB)

 * Bugfix: Throw a NoRouteToHostException if the StorageWrietClient can not
	       connect to the storage (SB)

 * Bugfix: Better error handling on malformed port definitions in
           SSHDeployer (SB)

 * Experimental: The JStorage configuration backend is still experimental,
                 but has received some love and is well on its way for
                 production readyness (SB)

=======================
2009-05-05: Summa 1.4.2
=======================

 * Move all facet configuration inside the index descriptor. This massively
   simplifies the configuration of the actual searcher and indexer services (SB)

 * Autostart the suggest service with the all.sh script in Summix (SB)

 * The SummaSearcher and the IndexController accept index-descriptor
   setup in the configuration root, copying the setup to search nodes
   and index manipulators (SB)

 * Use JLine to enable inline editing in the shells (client and control). This
   also bring history navigation and editing (SB)

 * Implement a fire-once filter; ClearBaseFilter, that clears a given set of
   bases the first time it receives a payload (SB)

 * Rework the starting/stopping/monitoring code in the client and control
   shells which should give mucg more usable feedback now, as well as not
   swallowing the terminal's prompt after some commands complete (SB)

 * Add Windows variant of the suggest-tool in Summix (Refind)

 * Add an --upgrade switch to the deploy command in the client-shell (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't allw starting of clients that are already running (fixed both
           control-shell and in the ControlCore itself) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Client could get stuck in an infinite loop when removing
           a service with the same instanceid for the second time (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't crash the ControlCore if it fails to parse client configs
           at startup (SB)

 * Bugfix: Whereever URL.getFile() was used, the code did not work
           when using paths with non-trivial characters, such as
           space and # (SB)

 * Experimental: Add a JStorage backend to the configuration system, reading
                 the config data from a Javascript file (SB)

=======================
2009-04-28: Summa 1.4.1
=======================

 * Make FilterService exit the JVM when underlying FilterControl stops.
   This behaviour can be tweaked via the property
   summa.control.service.exitwithfilter (SB)
 
 * Alphabetic sorting of bundles in the commands in control-shell and
   client-shell (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Make StorageService and SearchService able to restart cleanly (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Clean up messages from StatusMonitor reporting connectionIds
           of null (SB)

 * Bugfix: The WebServices did not work when the WAR-file contained
           a '#' (used to make URLs with slashes in tomcat) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Allow overriding configuration path in the Summix suggest-tool (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Fix process.log in Summix (Refind)


=======================
2009-04-24: Summa 1.4.0
=======================

 * Implement a Suggestion engine. For an example on how to use it see the
   Summix README. You will also find a suggest-tool.sh in Summix (SB)

 * Implement a MoreLikeThis service. It runs by default when using a
   LuceneSearchNode (SB)

 * Add a summa-support-api.jar file to the distribution (SB)

 * Much improved Windows scripts in Summix (SB)

 * Removed all usages of of the olde XmlOperations class from the Web module
   and use SBUtils xml handling throughout (SB)

 * In the Control module rename the concept of "client meta files"
   to "client control files". Control files are found in the client dir
   as control.xml. This means that there no longer is a
   ~/summa-control/meta directory (SB)

 * Add a command, 'control', on the control shell to inspect the
   deployment metadata of a deployed client (SB)

 * Added -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost to the Summix JVM invocation
   to avoid problems with firewalls and routing outside of the local computer
   (Refind)

 * Add a 'restart' command to the client shell (SB)

 * SummaSearcherImpl now supports using a static, non-monitored, index-root (SB)

 * Bugfix: The Facet building failed due to missing implementation
           of adjustPositions in the CoreMapBuilder (SB)

 * Bugfix: Allow surrounding whitespace in ints, longs, and booleans
           in configuration files (SB)

 * Bugfix: Make search-tool.sh detect its configuration properly (SB)

 * Bugfix: Spurious reporting of connections called 'null' in client- and
           control shells (SB)


=======================
2009-04-20: Summa 1.3.3
=======================

 * Fix infinite loop on empty tags introduced by a recent change in
   LuceneFacetBuilder (SB)

=======================
2009-04-20: Summa 1.3.2
=======================

 * Some tweaks to the commands in control-shell (SB):

   - 'repo' no longer requires a -l to work, -l is the default

   - 'deploy' defaults to to target host 'localhost' and now displays a better
     help message

   - Prettify some status codes in the 'clients -s' and 'status' comamnds

 * Don't default to setting summa.configuration=configuration.xml in the
   'start' command of the client shell. Just allow
   Configuration.getSystemConfiguration() in the service Launcher class
   to autodetect the config if the system property summa.configuration is unset.
   This allows for setting summa.configuration in places like
   bundles specs (service.xml and client.xml) and other useful stuff (SB)

 * The LuceneFacetBuilder did not discard empty Tags, which it does now (Refind)

 * The Windows commands search-tool.bat and storage-tool.bar in Samples/Summix
   now supports an arbitrary number of arguments (Refind)

 * The storage-tool.sh and search-tool.sh scripts from the Control module
   are now runnable from everywhere (SB)

 * When clicking a record in the demo website you now get the raw record
   contents dumped. This way the website can display all kinds of records even
   though no presentation XSLTs are provided (SB)

 * Include .war files from the Web module in Summix (SB)

 * Bugfix: When non-existing nested folders were stated in the
	       DumpFilter, it did not create the folders (SB)

 * Bugfix: Some folder structures triggered skipping of valid files
           in the FileReader (SB)


=======================
2009-04-16: Summa 1.3.1
=======================

 NOTE: Since Summa has now attracted third party contributors we will, starting
       from Summa 1.3.1, postfix each news entry with an attribution to the
       responsible party/parties enclosed in braces.

 * Add a MoreLikeThis capability to the LuceneSearchNode and a web service
   interface for this on the search web service (SB)

 * Allow web services in the Web module to fetch their configurations from
   outside the .war file, by using some JNDI-fu (SB)

 * Add a ScriptFilter that runs a Payload through any script engine supported
   by the JVM (such as Javascript). The script can be fetched externally or
   inlined in the configuration (SB)

 * Added DumpFilter which dumps Payloads into a designated folder. Used
   primarily for debugging (Refind)

 * The usual round of logging clarifications (SB, Refind)

 * Include a Samples module which as a start contains a very simple Summa
   setup called Summix. Summix does not depend on the Control framework used
   by Summa (think, bundles and services) and is mostly designed as a stand
   alone search engine for people without huge scalability needs. Summix
   also runs on Windows. (Refind)

 * Bump SBUtil from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4. This brings in new features in
   ReplaceFactory we need in order to optimize query analysis (SB)

 * Consolidation of the Lucene analyzers in the Common module. This means
   dropping TokenReplaceFilter, TransliteratingReader, StringReplaceReader,
   and TransliterionFilter from the source tree. All the replacement is now done
   entirely inside the ReplaceReaders from SBUtil. This brings a hefty
   optimization to query parser performance (at least a factor of 20) (SB)

 * Configurations can now escpae system properties inside integer, long, and
   boolean values. It only did strings before (SB)

 * Bugfix: Explicitly remove log4j.xml from the summa-common.jar

 * Bugfix: Add a 'process' appender to the log4j configuration in the
           sample bundles. Output goes to log/process.log (SB)

 * Bugfix: The AbstractDiscardFilter has its logic reversed so that
	       only Payloads that were judged discardable was preserved and vise
	       versa (Refind)

=======================
2009-03-27: Summa 1.3.0
=======================

 * IMPORTANT: The DerbyStorage and PostgresStorage backends are not functional
   in Summa 1.3.0. It is planned to fix them in later micro versions of the
   Summa 1.3 series

 * Make H2Storage the default storage backend

 * The 'data' column in H2Storage has been changed from type BLOB to type BYTEA.
   We know it is bad style to break the DB schemas but with type BLOB H2
   dumps _lots_ of small files with the content data. With BYTEA the data is
   inlined in the db resulting in a static number of 5 files for the db

 * Make DatabaseStorage use SQL transactions. While fixing some race conditions
   this also gives a huge performance boost on flush() and flushAll().
   This affects both H2Storage, DerbyStorage, and PostgresStorage

 * In the config for H2Storahe you now only specify the root folder of the db,
   not the root folder+fileprefix. The file prefix is always summa_h2storage

 * Bump H2 library to 1.1.109. This fixes a gradual performance degradation on
   H2Storage when inserting millions of records

 * Bump SBUtil dep. to 0.4.3

 * Rewrite of the core analyzers to use SBUtil 0.4.3. This brings a considerable
   performance booost to indexing speed

 * Use XSLT handling from SBUtil 0.4.3. This also means that XML transformations
   can now optionally ignore namespaces

 * Add runnable classes for launching the core Summa components without needing
   the entire Control framework. The following classes now has main methods
   detecting their config via the system prop. summa.configuration:
   FilterControl, SummaSearcherRunner, and StorageRunner

 * Optimize building of the facet structure by introducing an internal cache,
   and by avoiding some memory allocations inside loops

 * Change sorting strategy for disk based facets to use merge-sort
   instead of heap-sort. This results in a lot less disk IO and coupled
   with a cache for persistent values, this speeds up the sort after dirty
   adds tremendously

 * Changed FileReader to resolve files lazily. Before this change it build
   a full list of all files before starting. This took a considerable amount of
   time if the data dir contained hundred of thousands of files

 * Changed the default queue-size and sleep-time for ThreadedStreamParser as
   the old defaults resulted in poor performance

 * Tweak the default sizes of the PayloadQueues in MUXFilterFeeder
   to 100 Payloads instead of 1 (the memory-limit default is 1MByte). This may
   give a performance boost on some setups depending on MUXFilters

 * Introduce two new field types; 'verbatim' and 'storedVerbatim' which will
   index the field contents as one unaltered token (with casing and diacritics),
   but keep it searchable. In contrast the field types 'keyword' and
   'storedKeyword' are case insensitive and removes non-alphanumeric symbols,
   but also indexing the content as a single token

 * Better handling of failures in the ingest- and index chains by introducing
   a PayloadException and return codes from ObjectFilterImpl.processPayload()

 * Add an explicit log to follow record/payload lifetimes

 * Bugfix: The ServiceObj (responsible for handling SOAP-requests) failed
           randomly on multi-threading

 * Bugfix: Merging of DocumentResponses did not update the total
	       number of hits

 * Bugfix: The TagHandler didn't perform dirty adds when asked to do so

 * Bugfix: The FacetSearchNode did not open the TagHandlers in read-only mode

 * Bugfix: Fix handling of quoted arguments to search-tool. This makes it
           possible to do phrase searches with the search-tool

 * Bugfix: The AbstractDiscardFilter (and its subclasses) wasn't
	       actually ObjectFilters, they just had all the methods

 * Bugfix: Made the FileReader auto-close delivered Streams when they reach
           EOF. This guards against file handle starvation

 * Bugfix: The IndexDescriptor class checked for changed descriptors
           all the time when the check-interval was 0. The correct behaviour
           is not to check when the interval is 0

 * Bugfix: Fix compliance to ReadableStorage contract in StorageReaderClient -
           to throw a NoSuchElementException when the iter is depleted in
           next(iterKey) and next(iterKey, maxRecords)

 * Bugfix: AggregatingStorage did not support base=null in
           getModificationTime() and getRecordsModifiedAfter()

 * Bugfix: The FileReader had a race-condition for closing and
           renaming files that was triggered by the FileWatchers
           multi-threaded usage of FileReader

 * Bugfix: FilterService, FilterControl, and FilterPump will now properly
           shut down and wait for all payloads to be processed before
           shutting down when invoking close()/stop() on them

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger is now more forgiving if the records does
           not declare their type correctly

 * Bugfix: Fix deadlock when closing down a RecordReader with a StorageWatcher

 * Bugfix: Bugfix: queue.offer was used by FacetSearchNode and DocIDCollector
           without check for success. This has been changed to put with a
           retry in case of interruptions

=======================
2009-02-18: Summa 1.2.1
=======================

 * Add options to RecordReader for deciding whether or not to request
   parent/child expansion when receiving records

 * You can now specify the port used by the SSHDeployer. This means that you can
   now do stuff like 'deploy foo-client-1 c1 localhost:220' in the control-shell
   if your sshd run on port 220 instead opf 22

 * Add a new class RecordUtil in the Common module that can serialize
   Record objects to and from XML efficiently. There's also an XML schema for
   this XML format. Record contents will be XML escaped and any parent/child
   records will be embedded in the XML

 * Add a DelayFilter to facilitate throttling of filter chains (fx. if the
   index process eats up to much cpu)

 * Added a DiscardUpdatesFilter that discards records with ids that has
   already passed it. That is it prevents any updates being done on an index
   or storage consuming the filter chain

 * Added a DiscardRelativesFilter that discards records based on their
   relatives. This can fx. be used to discard all records that has any parents
   from the filter chain

 * Added a reverse-sort option to FileReader, making it possible to iterate over
   found files in reverse unicode order
   
 * Bugfix: Assigning the same source multiple times to MUXFilter resulted in
   the last Payloads of a stream of Payloads being skipped under certain
   race-conditions

 * Bugfix: The round-robin used by the MUXFilter always selected the first
   available filter

 * Bugfix: Record did not clear the list of parents when setParentID was set

 * Way too many test cases and bug fixes to list here. Seriously.

=======================
2009-02-09: Summa 1.2.0
=======================
 
 * Add a new mode to the FacetManipulator doing blazingly fast batch updates.
   This strategy will be used by default when doing consolidates
 
 * Add an optional skipupdates property to the facet builder, making it
   possible to postpone facet building until commit or consolidate
 
 * Implement a SummaSearcherAggregator facilitating distributed searches
 
 * More intuitive and fail safe configuration of filters by using lists of
   subconfigurations rather than using named subconfigurations and refering to
   them by their names
 
 * Massive speed update(s) in the indexer
   
   - Implement a streaming Lucene document creator instead of
     the old DOM based one
   
   - Use thread local caches in our Analyzers to minimize garbage collection of
     object instantiations
   
   - Fix big bottle neck where we parsed the transliteration rules one time
     for each field in each document!
   
   - Also use thread local caches in our XSLT plugins and make sure we do a
     minimum of string replacements
 
 * Records use lazy gzip compression/decompression of contents to minimize
   network overhead
 
 * Make MARC multi volume handling work both on the storage level and on the
   ingest level
 
 * Improve update rules for the RecordReader filter
 
 * Improve time granularity in the RecordReader to milliseconds (was seconds)

 * Fix bug where we leaked abandoned iterators in the DatabaseStorage

 * Major overhaul of the Storage API:
   
   - Remove getRecordsFrom()
          
   - Remove getRecordsFromBase()
          
   - Add a QueryOptions parameter to all ReadableStorage methods. This
     new parameter is used to control parent/child expansion as well
     as whether to retrieve deleted/indexable records
   
   - Always sort result sets by mtime
 
 * New backends for the database storage as Derby seems to have some problematic
   performance issues:
   
    - PostgresQL
    
    - H2 (the new default)
 
 * Other updates on the database Storage implementations
 
   - Proper connection- and statement pooling on all database Storage backends
   
   - All mtime timestamps are now globally uniqye withing the storage.
     To go finer than the millisecond granularity provided by the Java system
     timestamps (System.nanoSeconds() is not applicable here) we use a salted
     timestamp packed in a long
   
   - Two "modes" for the backend implementations of DatabaseStorage are
     supported (the new H2Storage applies both these modes)
     
       o Paging - meaning that only small result sets are queried at a time
       
       o Lazy relation lookups, not doing JOINs on the DB, but looking relations
         up when needed
    
   - Added query timings to storage-tool and added a 'dump' command as well
     to do a raw dump of the entire storage or a single base
 
 * Bump internal version of libraries:
 
   - Lucene 2.3.0 -> 2.4.0
   
   - Derby 10.3.1.4 -> 10.4.2.0

 * Add support for the URLRepository class to list repository contents via
   a bundles.list file on the server

 * Create a generic Record generator for use in test scenarios. It can can
   create records with random content based on a configurable criteria

 * Configuration files can now escape system properties enclosed in
   Ant style brackets. Eg. "${user.home}/summa-database"

 * Bundle specs can now contain zero to many <jvmArg> tags that will be added
   verbatim to the command line for the bundle when it is launched

 * Added a bunch of tests cases covering all the metadata formats employed at
   the State and University Library

 * Introduce summa-bundletool, a command line helper tool used to create and
   validate bundles

 * Optimize the commiting of records to the storage

 * XML Schema for the Summa Document format used by the indexer

 * XML Schema for the Summa index descriptor format

 * Implement a Workflow module that can execute a generic "workflow" based
   on an XML file. This can be used to implement daemons that reset bases,
   downloads data dumps, starts indexing processes and what not.

 * Fix some tricky namespacing bugs in XMLSplitter

 * Remove hard RMI dependency from shell tools, they now use a generic RPC
   mechanism to talk to the servers

 * The control-shell and client-shell command line tools are now fully
   scriptable. Supplying exatr commands when launching them will also make
   them run the commands and exit. For more info try the 'help exec' command
   added to these tools

 * Lots of work on making the debugging messages in the log files more helpful

 * Make unit tests independent of hardcoded paths such as /tmp

 * Write a tool (doc/summa-doc-tool) that extracts property definitions and
   their documentation from the Java source files. Result can be seen on the
   wiki at: http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Properties

 * Implement a FilterSequence, a filter that runs through a series of
   child filters

 * Implement a MUXFilter that can mux payloads/records between different
   child-filters based on the record base of the payload

 * Log profiling/statistics information in Filter framework
 
 * Proper retraction of MBeans and remote interfaces when closing a service

 * Solved bug that made the IndexController commit for each Record
 
 * Tonnes of bug fixes


=======================
2008-10-31: Summa 1.1.0
=======================

The Summa team is proud to announce the immediate availability of Summa 1.1.

A ton of work has gone into this new release and we are very are confident that
it will pave the way for an interesting time for library search egnines.

With this release Summa has reached a point where it is on feature parity
(but a lot more powerful) than the old Summa we run in production on out
main site statsbiblioteket.dk.

If you are interested in the future development of Summa take a look at
http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Community/RoadMap which already contains
the roadmap for 1.2 and beyond.

The release code be downloaded in binary or source form from

  http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Community/Download

It can also be check out from a dedicated SVN tag:

  svn co https://gforge.statsbiblioteket.dk/svn/summa/tags/summa-1.1.0

Here follows a summary of development that has gone into Summa 1.1:

New Features:

 * The whole workflow from ingest, indexation, to facet computation is now
   fully incremental

 * MARC and Aleph handling code has been updated to work with the new
   filter-based ingest model

 * Autostart of Clients and Services. This is currently only enabled in the
   test-client-1 and test-storage-1 bundles

 * Add a method for removing deployed services from a client

 * Introduce a new Workflow module that can execute workflows specified
   in an XML format. At SB we will use this handle special cases where some
   data sources needs to be reset each time updates arrive

 * Add StorageWatcher class that can monitor a storage instance for changes
   to certain bases

 * The Storage API has seen a major overhaul. The old one leake implementation
   details and where not properly extensible by third parties without accessing
   some Summa internals. The new API is void of implementation details can be
   properly extended

 * Implement an AggregatingStorage that aggregates multiple sub-storage
   instances (in a distributed environment) an exposes them as a single
   storage instance

 * Record data is now passes compressed over the wire an uncompressed lazily

 * The DatabaseStorage class now implements parent-child relationsships for
   records (which means that the default storage, DerbyStorage, will too).
   This is used for multi-volume handling and in the future FRBR


Misc:

 * Web service .war files now contain build information (Summa version number)

 * Removed deprecated and outdated code and config files. You can find the old
   code in the attic/ subdirectory in each module

 * storage-tool.sh now supports an 'xslt' switch that can apply an xslt to a
   given record

 * Add 'spec' command to client shell that can display the bundle spec for the
   client or a given service

 * Add 'remove' command to client shell that can remove a deployed service from
   the client

Bugs Fixed:

 * Time stamp granularity in Storage was 1s. The new granularity is 1ms

 * Fixes to 'distclean' targets in a few modules (to do proper build cleanup)

 * Updated base modification time in WriatbleStorage.clearBase()

 * The Client only listed the services deployed during its current JVM session,
   it now lists all services deployed

 * Certain cases where a missing secutiry manager would mess up RMI

 * Lots and lots of lower profile bugs


=======================
2008-09-15: Summa 1.0.0
=======================

 * Minor bug fixes

 * Tweaks to configurations of example bundles

 * Test website displays a message when no facets are found

=======================
2008-09-12: Summa 0.9
=======================

 * Add webservices for Search and Storage

 * Add a small test website

 * Enable facet generation by default

 * Tons of bug fixes

 * Major rename of all configuration properties to used a consistent naming scheme

=======================
2008-09-02: Summa 0.8
=======================

This marks the first milestone towards the stable open source release of Summa.

It is important to note that this is not a stable, or anywhere near production,
release. It is a development snapshot made when we reached a collection of
internally set goals.

The feature set of this release is not much more than what you will find on the
tutorial page at :

      http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Tutorials/MinimalDeployment0.8.0

 LocalWords:  didyoumean


========================
2010-03-24: Summa 1.5.4
========================
 
 * Feature: Did-You-Mean service built index on start-up, iff index 
   is not already present. Searching while building index results in 
   an empty search response.
   Added DidYouMean support to the sample website.

 * NOTICE: Did-You-Mean static root for index is renamed to 'index' 
   since the index created by FSDirectory is by default placed in
   the directory 'didyoumean'.

 * NOTICE: didyoumean.xml config file, uses a RAMDirectory as standard.
   Should be changed to FSDirectory if using large indexes to generate 
   the Did-You-Mean index.
	  
 * Feature: Added merge method to merge responses to Did-You-Mean
   service.

 * Feature: Added Did-You-Mean search tool. Found in
   'didyoumean-tool.sh' or 'didyoumean-tool.bat'.

 * Feature: Status and Sample website now shows version number and
   revision tag. This fixes #78 in tracker.

 * Bugfix: Updated SearchWS so it now returns valid XML, when an
   error occur in creation of a search response. See schema 
   'SearchErrorResponse.xsd' for details.

 * Bugfix: Sample and status websites are updated to XHTML 1.0.   

 * Bugfix: in PriorityQueue.

 * Cleanup in ant targets.
   - ant jars - which builds all jar/war files and creates 
                '/dist/summa-test-$version.zip', with all jars 
                and wars, along with a summix.
	              This is done in approximately 20 seconds on ssd.
   - ant release - builds a full release zip in /dist.
                This takes approximately 105 seconds on ssd.
   Furthermore each module has the possibility to make a 'jar' or 
   'release'.
 
========================
2010-03-11: Summa 1.5.3
========================

 * NOTICE: The didYouMean web services is only experimetal. API and 
    configuration keys may still change.

 * Added UpdateFromFulldumpFilter which from a fulldump treat the dump
 	  as an update on a single base. This means:
	  - updating changed records.
	  - delete non-existing records.
	  - records that hasn't changed are ignored.

 * Feature: Added Did-You-Mean support for FSDirectory as well as
	  RAMDirectory. This is a configuration.
		Feature: Added didyoumean tool to Samples/
    Updated Did-You-Mean example response xml and schema.

 * Feature: Added junit test functionality to all ant files, which
	  include generating xml and html files for showing result of junit
	  tests on a single webpage.
	  NOTE: The control module, is not working at this point.

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger threw an Exception logging
	  errors for multi volume.

 * Bugfix: The DatabaseStorage made a single commit at the end of
	  base delete. In the current version of h2, this commit required a
	  very large amount of memory (½GB+ for 400K records). This has
	  been changed to commit every 500 records, which has very little
	  memory overhead.

 * Bugfix: Fixed ticket #31, now RecordUtil.toXML doesn't show the
	  underlying XML framework to API.
	  
 * Bugfix: Added teardown method, to stop storage and close connections.


========================
2010-02-19: Summa 1.5.2
========================
 
 * NOTICE: The didYouMean web services is only experimetal. API and 
    configuration keys may still change.

 * Bugfix: Updated status page, so it present a valid html site. 

 * Bugfix: Added LuceneIndexDescriptor.xsd schema

 * Bugfix: Updated sample xml response, to be consisted in naming
 	 	with schemas

 * Bugfix: Storage.batchJob() would
		set the 'last' variable in the batch job whenever the job crossed
	  a page boundary while iterating over the selected records for the
	  batch job

 * Feature: Expose a didYouMean webservice under the standard SearchWS. 
    Web service can return more than one result, this is configurable 
    at query time, defaulting to 1.
		Import Lucene didyoumean libs from
	  			 http://github.com/mkamstrup/lucene-didyoumean/downloads

 * Feature: Sleep time in 
    Workflow/src/dk/statsbiblioteket/summa/workflow/WaitForStatusStep.java
    is now configurable.

 * Feature: Implement a 'batchjob' command for storage-tool.sh

 * Release includes all xsd schemas for xml responses found in /doc/schema/

========================
2010-02-05: Summa 1.5.1
========================

 * Bugfix: Proper escaping of messages from sub-services in the status web
           service. The status web service would return invalid XML if any
           of the monitored services returned properties with names that
           was not valid XML.

========================
2010-01-27: Summa 1.5.00
========================
	  
 * NOTICE: Convert entire Summa source tree to Apache 2 license

 * Storage ABI break (source compatibility preserved): Add variants
	  of flush() and flushAll() that takes an extra QueryOptions
	  parameter.

 * ABI break: Add setter methods for QueryOptions.meta(). We alreay
	  broke the Storage binary protocol so it's no biggie.

 * Update H2 dep. to 1.2.126, which among other fixes includes: "The
	  database is now closed after an out of memory exception, because
	  the database could get corrupt otherwise.". and disable the H2 
    level 2 cache by default for SuggestStorageH2.

 * New API Storage.batchJob for running predefined batch jobs in any 
 	  scripting language accrose of subsets of the storage.
	  Bundled sample batch jobs with Summix: 
		collect_ids.job.js, delete.job.js, and count.job.js 
 
 * Add a 'holdings' command to storage-tool

 * Add a __holdings__ record to storage containing detailed storage 
 	  statistic. Show storage __holdings__ in status page and feed
	  The holdings can also be looked up with the "holdings" action in
	  storage-tool.sh

 * Define a meta flag "TRY_UPDATE", which alter default behaviour of 
    Storage.flush() and Storage.flushAll() to not update records if they 
		already are up to date.
	
 * New boolean property on RecordWriter:
	  "summa.storage.recordwriter.tryupdate" to pass TRY_UPDATE=true in
	  the QueryOptions to flushAll()

 * Bugfix: Allow both old and new H2 file formats in H2Storage and
	  SuggestStorageH2 (ie. allow both .data.db and .h2.db)

 * Bugfix: There was an elusive deadlock in QueuedInputStream used
	  by the ZipParser class. It both involved a missing 'synchronized'
	  statement and a bad cast of byte to int. We have replaced the
	  entire implementation with Java's native Piped{In,Out}putStream.

 * Bugfix: The result of an IndexLookup was scrabled when a
	  sortLocale was defined for the facet

 * Bugfix: The FacetResults did not perform entity escaping
	  correctly

 * Bugfix: UniqueTimestampGenerator.MAX_TIME was not constructed
	  correctly and was in fact negative!

 * Bugfix: LuceneManipulator kept running in the event of out of
	  disk space

 * BugFix: Tag-representations were double entity-encoded

 * Bugfix: The SortedPoolImpl was not thread-safe for reads

 * BugFix: Sort failed with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if
	  certain documents did not contain a term for the sort field

 * Bugfix: The sample website did not support sorted search or
	  paging

 * Bugfix: The MultipassSortcomparator works now, but used the
	  memory-inefficient BitsArrayInts
	  Testing: A bug has been discovered in BitsArrayPacked, where
	  assigning to a value nullifies the subsequent value

 * Feature: Made the LuceneManipulator optionally multi threaded
	  (deafult is 1 thread, which mimicks the old behaviour). As par of
	  this, the IndexManipulator-interface was extended with support
	  for signalling if the order of documents gets unreliable

 * Feature: Added filter for post-processing in ingest workflows
	  involving full dumps. The primary usage is clearing of old data
	  from Storage

 * Feature: Provided an option for enabling lenient marc-parsing in
	  ISO2709ToMARCXMLFilter

 * Feature: Made it possible to specify the sort comparators used by
	  a LuceneSearchNode, making it possible to choose between memory
	  usage and speed when sorting fields with many terms. Still in the
	  experimental phase

 * Make StorageRunner.main(), SummaSearcherRunner.main(), and
	  FilterControl.main() do a System.exit(1) if they encounter a fatal 
		top level exception

 * Use 'set -e' in all Summix .sh script to have them bail out on
	  any uncaught errors

 * Make all Summix .sh shell scripts use 'exec' when launching their
	  primary child process. This way we don't litter 3 processes for
	  each service - we have one process/service and that is that of
	  the JVM.

 * Logging for Summix: Services now log to log/<service-type>.log
	  and log/<service-type>.fatal.log. All *-tool.sh log to
	  log/tools.log. Here <service-type> is derived from the basename of
		the config file

========================
2009-12-02: Summa 1.4.15
========================

 * Bump SB Util dependency to 0.4.8. This enables some fixes in our collator
   based sorts as well as some more aggresive fast pathing of XSLT processing
   when namespaces are ignored (SB)

 * Include "Most popular queries the last 24 hours" in the status page and
   rss feed (SB)

 * Implemented PipedStream: A bridge from OutputStream to InputStream
   with buffering and callback

 * Bugfix/logging: Make sure we always store the last 5 fatal.log (or error.log)
                  files (we used to only store 2)

 * Remove all attic code as agreed with Toke. To dig out the attic code from
   svn it is probably easiest to do:

     svn co https://summa.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/summa/tags/summa-1.4.14

 * The status web service now exposes a xml.jsp, index.jsp, and rss.jsp. All
   fully working (however with minimal content for now).
   The RSS feed will be marked as updated if any one of the following
   conditions hold:
	  - There is an error anywhere
	  - The storage/index has been been updated since last check

 * New helper classes in Web module to help build RSS feeds

 * Made the ID-delimiter configurable in Aleph2XML

 * Bugfix: Changed all usages of Collator to (optionally where appropriate)
           consider space a char that goes before any other chars (SB)

 * Bugfix: Disable the level 2 cache in the H2Storage by default. Some memory
           balloning has been experienced with the L2 cache enabled (SB)

 * Bugfix: The status webservice did not allow duplicate keys in a group.
           This made queryCount reporting throw away queries with the same
           count. Rant: Why is there no SortedList class in Java!? (SB)

========================
2009-11-23: Summa 1.4.14
========================

 * IMPORTANT: Updated core storage database libs. H2 upgraded from 1.1.118
   to 1.2.124. This brings along a new optimized db storage format that gives
   better disk usage and faster queries.
   In order to use the new storage format you need to completely rebuild your
   storage - by deleting all the old storage files. Summa continues to work
   with the old storage files, but you will not benefit from the newest
   enhancements.

 * New exception policy: When any service encounters an uncaught exception in
   a thread it will be treated as a fatal error and the JVM will exit leaving
   fatal errors in the log and on stderr.

 * Bugfix: Fix a very elusive bug where the storage would corrupt its internal
           indexes. The only symptom was that one could no longer retrieve
           batches of records with the getRecordsModifiedAfter() method.
           It would always return an empty iterator.
           This bug was very hard to reproduce except on some specific hardware
           and operating systems. Nonetheless it was there.

 * Bugfix: Fix NullPointerException when running a filter chain that was closed
           without ever having received any payloads.

========================
2009-11-18: Summa 1.4.13
========================

 * Optimization: Storage.clearBase() would at times require big memory
                 allocations. This has been partly remedied. The execution
                 speed of this function should also have improved somewhat.

 * Add a new filter MachineStatsFilter logging stats about the JVM. This is
   enabled by default in the Summix indexer and ingester

 * Log JVM stats from StorageRunner and SummaSearcherRunner. This means that
   Storage and Searcher services in Summix will log stats by default

 * Enable the log4j CleanSlateRollingFileAppender appender in the Summix
   log4j config.

 * Error handling: Major reworking of RMI wrapper classes to handle
	               Errors by sending alerts and shutting down. Note that we
	               are talking Errors and not normal Exceptions

 * Bugfix: Calling close() on ZIPParser before EOF left the
           ZIP-thread hanging

 * Bugfix: Fixed racing deadlock problem in ZIPParser

 * Bugfix: There was a chance that the ThreadedStreamParser did not
           terminate properly when close on sourcePayload failed

========================
2009-11-03: Summa 1.4.12
========================

 * Critical bugfix: When clearing a base via ClearBaseFilter or any other means,
                    the H2Storage module (the default) had a race condition
                    causing a risk of the database indexes would be corrupted.

 * New web service StatusWS. Can collect a very simple status report from
   the storage-, searcher-, and suggest services. We plan to expand this
   functionality in the future. Especially more detailed status from each
   service and the ability to get the status as an RSS feed

 * Optimized the special case of a standard search where the number of wanted
   records is 0. The use case here is asking for a hit count on a given query,
   without needing the records

 * Less verbose logging from MARCParser

 * Changed the default timeout for ZIP to Integer.MAX_VALUE, as ZIP-files
   containing very large files can take a lot of time to process

 * Major cleanup of ThreadedStreamParser, reducing formerly complex logic to
   clearly defined and consistent workflow

 * Added the inverse equivalent to ContentToStreamFilter, namely a
   StreamToContentFilter - creating a Record payload from a stream payload
   with the record content set to the contents of the stream

 * Bugfix: The clearBase() method on DerbyStorage didn't work

 * Bugfix: The PayloadQueue did not add the size of parents and
           children to the size for a Record

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger had a one-off error that was
           triggered by XML without linebreaks between tags

 * Bugfix: Changed build to include dtd and ent for XHTML entity
           resolver

========================
2009-10-22: Summa 1.4.11
========================
 
 * WARNING: Another DB schema change for the suggest service
 
 * WARNING: ABI break for FacetResultExternal. This will require you to run
            the same version of Summa on your web services as your Summa
            search engine

 * New API for the suggest web service; getRecentSuggestions. Used to
   retrieve the last N suggestions updated within the last X seconds.
   
 * New API for the search web service; filterSearchSorted. Used to pass
   in an extra filter-query that will not affect the ranking of the "real"
   query. This is useful
 
 * The default Suggest engine backend (SuggestStorageH2) now features a 
   "query sanitizer" (which is a configurable class of Lucene Analyzer
   controlled by the property summa.support.suggest.sanitizer) that will be
   run over user queries to be added to the DB. The default is a 
   Lucene WhitespaceAnalyzer which will result in the fix for the bug
   mentioned below (bug #61)
 
 * A new RollingFileAppender for Log4J that rolls the logs each time the
   application starts. Set the class attribute of the appender element
   in your log4j.xml to
   dk.statsbiblioteket.summa.common.util.CleanSlateRollingFileAppender
 
 * Bump SBUtil to 0.4.7. This should improve performance on some XSLT operations
 
 * Bugfix: The merging of Facet results from different searcher
           setups failed when the facets weren't the same
   
 * Bugfix: Fix #59: The XMLSplitterHandler did not handle multiple default
           name spaces properly
 
 * Bugfix: Patch from Jens Henrik Jensen (SB) to fix some issues
           with the client-shell.sh, control-shell, and control.sh scripts:
            - Set the script mode to always exit on errors
            - Be runnable disregarding the working dir
            - To not call popd as last function in the script,
              overriding the exit value of command

 * Bugfix: ReaderInputstream did not close th encapsulated
           Inputstream upon close
 
 * Bugfix: The toXML-method in RecordUtil performen an endless
           recursion when parent-child-relations were double-linked

 * Bugfix: Fix bug #63: "Suggestions with same normalized key show
           same hitcount"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix bug #61: "Whitespace garbage in suggest strings"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix bug #65: "ZipException: invalid bit length repeat; during
           ingest". The trick is to ensure that all operations on the
           ZipInputStream happen in the same thread. This is achieved by
           implementing a QueuedInputStream that holds an internal blocking
           queue all data is pushed over. There's a lot of room for
           optimization here, see the fixme in the header for QueuedInputStream
 
========================
2009-09-14: Summa 1.4.10
========================

 * The RecordWriter filter, responsible for inserting Records into Storage,
   now has a memory cap for its internal queue that can be set via the
   summa.storage.recordwriter.batchmaxmemory property. Huge Records could cause
   freak OOMs on the Storage

 * New deployment mechanism LocalDeployer that can be used to bypass the need
   for an SSH session when deploying+starting a client on a local machine.
   Pass '-t local' to the 'deploy' command when deploying a client from
   the control-shell

 * A lot of work on the Suggest service - particularly some serious
   performance issues should have been ironed out

    - Compare strings by normalizing them with a Lucene analyzer,
      using SummaKeywordAnalyzer by default

    - The property summa.support.suggest.lowercasequeries has been renamed to
	  summa.support.suggest.normalizequeries since we can do more advanced
	  transformations now (see point above)

    - Introduces max rows setting to h2 backend for suggest, ensuring
      lower response times for parts of a large result set (for example single
      character prefixes)

    - Make import for suggest drop and re-create indexes,
	  greatly improving import performance

	- Add a new search key to fetch the most recently updated sugegstions.
	  Pass in summa.support.suggest.recent to test this out. It is also
	  supported in suggest-tool.sh shipped in Summix

 * WARNING: The afore mentioned work on the Suggest service has broken the
   database layout of the default backend SuggestStorageH2. You will need to
   export your old data and import it in a new empty suggest instance

 * search-tool.sh will now echo the search response time in ms (also applies
   to suggest-tool.sh)

 * Created ContentToStreamFilter to wrap content from Record into a
    Stream on Payload

 * Made the XMLSplitter optionally namespace-aware with regard to
   record specification

 * Bugfix: The RecordWriter needed to run with debug logging enabled
           in order to run at oeak performance

 * Bugfix: The StreamingDocumentCreator filter that is responsible for creating
           Lucene documents could raise StackOverflowErrors on huge
           SummaDocuments. This was caused by a misuse of recursion inside the
           XMLStreamReader shipped with Java, see:
	       http://sbdevel.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/an-excursion-in-java-recursion/

 * Bugfix: ScriptFilter did not resolve the script engine correctly when
           sniffing only on the script extension.

=======================
2009-09-01: Summa 1.4.9
=======================

 * The ClearBaseFilter can now select to clear the configured base only
   if the incoming payload matches a criteria in the same that a RegexFilter
   matches Payloads+Records (SB)

 * Make the default Storage backend (H2Storage) perform an analyze
   every 100000 records on flushAll, and skip the corresponding analysis
   on startup. This should improve boot times on big databases considerably (SB) 

 * Added clear/import/export commands to the Suggest service. Also supported
   by the command line tool 'suggest-tool.sh' (SB)

 * Enable the H2 second level LRU page cache by default. This should speed up
   large bases, but might be a small hit for smaller bases. This feature
   can be controlled via the summa.storage.database.l2cache boolean property

 * when specifying a static root for SummasearcherImpl, it will now be
   expanded with Resolver.getPersistentFile instead of being used directly

 * Bugfix: Make sure that the database indexes are used in the H2 Suggest
           backend (SB)

 * Bugfix: Log uncaught exceptions in the RecordBatcher thread in
           the RecordWriter filter (SB)

 * Bugfix: In DatabaseStorage explicitly rollback connections with
           any errors detected (the rollbacks where implicit from closing
           the connection before - this is not good JDBC behaviour) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Bundle Tool should escape property refs inside <jvmArg>
           tags (SB)

 * Bugfix: Fix db connection leak in flushAll() when we fail to set
         the connection in write-mode. This is categorized as a
         corner-case bug, but a bug nonetheless (SB)

 * Bugfix: Added check for endless recursion in H2Storage.touchParent

=======================
2009-08-18: Summa 1.4.8
=======================

 * Added setting for filters in FilterSequence to control whether the filter
   is enabled or not. Set the property "filter.enabled" to true or false to
   control this

 * New new filter called TikaDocumentCreator that creates Lucene documents
   directly from Tika XHTML events. This bypasses the needs for XSLT processing
   and can provide big performance gains where raw Tika processing is applicable

 * New filters RecordShaperFilter and DocumentShaperFilter for restructuring and'
   handling record metadata and Lucene document fields (respectively) in the
   filter pipeline

 * XMLSplitterFilter supports splitting streams into Records without
   extracting IDs. This is useful in conjunction with the new RecordShaperFilter

 * Bump SBUtil dependency to 0.4.6

 * Introduce experimental API to do super fast alphabetical index listings via the
   facet browser. See dk.statsbiblioteket.summa.facetbrowser.api.IndexKeys for
   a starting point

 * Bugfix: Automagically free all RMI services registered via the
           RemoteHelper when the JVM exits (this means pertty much all RMI
           services). This should fix some bugs where the services refused
           to come back up when started from a ClientShell, but killed with
           'kill <pid>' from a Unix shell. The problem was that Java doesn't
           do this clean up by default - go figure

 * Bugfix: Don't resolve DTDs in the XMLSplitter{Parser,Handler,Filter}

 * Bugfix: Fix https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/summa/ticket/41 - 
           "Search-time boosts in the IndexDescriptor are not used"
 
 * Bugfix: Fix https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/summa/ticket/28 -
          "DatabaseStorage.clearBase() doesn't update record mtimes"

=======================
2009-06-26: Summa 1.4.7
=======================

 * Critical bugfix: The ThreadedStreamParser class, which is the base class for
                    many of the core filters, could drop payloads when the
                    internal queue was overflowed

=======================
2009-06-23: Summa 1.4.6
=======================

 * New default: The storage web service will longer XML-escape the embedded
   record contents. To control this behavior set the property
   summa.common.recordutil.escapecontent to true or false (SB)

 * Include a RegexFilter that can black- or white list Payloads based on
   regex matching on their, id, base, and/or content (SB)

 * Add a new backend for the ThreadedStreamParser filter, called ZIPParser.
   This can be used as a filter for extracting Payloads from a zip stream (SB)

 * Changed the threadedStreamParser to use PayloadQueue which allows for
   limit on queue-size based on memory usage

 * Enhanced Suggest to allow for switching between case-sensitive and
   case-insensitive operation (SB)

 * Added listSuggestions and addSuggestions to Suggest to prepare for
   export and import of bulk lists of suggestions (SB)

 * Experimental: Extraction and merging of Lucene index term statistics. This
   is intended to be used in the upcoming "distributed ranking on a
   sharded index" (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: The threadedStreamParser did not close Payloads on
           exceptions (Refind)

 * Bugfix: The PayloadQueue failed when queueing Payloads without Records
           with a fixed ceiling on memory usage (SB)

 * Bugfix: The H2 suggest storage did not store queryCount for
           new suggestions (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't hardcode port 27000 and remote console in the DeployCommand
           on ControlShell

=======================
2009-06-04: Summa 1.4.5
=======================

 * Bump SBUtil dependency to 0.4.5 (SB)

 * Bump internal Derby dep. to the new 10.5.1.1 hotness. This brings in
   client side paging via LIMIT/FETCH clauses which has been much awaited (SB)

 * Add a TikaFilter that extracts metadata from crawled files and converts them
   to an intermediate XHTML structure. This can be used as the base for a
   hard disk indexer (SB)

 * A new filter, ReplaceFilter, that can replace substrings in Records or
   streams (Refind)

 * New filter, StdOutFilter, that drops Records (or optionally only their
   content) to stdout (Refind)

 * Added optional forceConsolidateOnClose to the IndexController (SB)

 * Include a ScriptService service class that launches an inlined or external
   script (anything supported by Java's ScriptEngine API) wrapped behind
   a Service interface (SB)

 * Inject a 'log' variable into ScriptFilter that can be used to access the
   common-logging logger of the filter (SB)

 * Make clearTagsOnConsolidate default to true as it speeds up facet building
   tremendously for larger indexes (SB)

 * Bugfix: It was not possible to dertermine the payload ids of failed payloads
           from ObjectFilterImpls (which means most filters) when the process
           threw a non-Exception throwable. These cases are now logged very
           verbosely because they often hide very nasty bugs (OOM etc) (SB)

 * Bugfix: The maxTags in the FacetScructure configuration was used
           as wantedTags when doing faceting, resulting in 200 tags/facet
           for the default setup (SB)

 * Bugix: Exceptions from FilterControl, SummaSearcherRunner, and
          StorageRunner's main() methods could be dropped. Install
          uncaught exception handlers that logs any top level exceptions (SB)

 * Bugfix: RecordUtil.toXML() did not close <element> tags in the
           <meta> section (Refind)

 * Bugfix: The {Memory,Disk}Pools did not accept adds with position
           above their size (SB)

 * Bugfix: DerbyStorage works again now (and is probably a lot faster than
           before, but this is yet to be tested) (SB)

=======================
2009-05-19: Summa 1.4.4
=======================

 * Critical Bugfix: The web services leaked connections to search, suggest
                    and storage

 * Ported a Lucene sorter that uses cached collator and
   index-based sorting from Stable Summa to head. This should
   provide a speed-increase for sorted searches along with less
   memory consumption (thill not ideal though. For that we need to
   hack the faceting system)

 * The Javascript configuration backend, JStorage, is now marked as stable,
   although it has not seen extensive real-world tests

 * Lots of polish to the client/control shells:

    - Don't print debug messages by default in the shell

    - Print the correct Summa version number when starting a
	  shell instead of some outdated CVS-mumbo-jumbo

	- Make the shell Core exit when the input stream is closed.
	  This way one can pipe commands into the shell with standard unix
	  pipes as well as exit the shell with Ctrl-d

	- Allow fetching status of deployed services from the
	  Control shell. Just pass clientId/serviceId to the status command

	- Add command to list services deployed on a client directly from
	  the Control shell, optionally printing the status of each service

	- Add a -f/--format switch to 'services' and 'status' commands on client-
	  and control shells. With this switch enabled they print out in a canonical
	  machine parseable format

	- Add -w and --wait to the 'start' command in the Client
	  shell and implement a 'wait' command as well

	- Add a -b and --bundle switch to the 'services' command
	  in client- and control shells

 * Make it configurable whether the Client keeps old services in the
   artifacts/ dir after it has removed a service. The relevant
   property is summa.control.client.storeartifacts

 * Make it possible to install clients under another base path than
   ~/summa-control. The easiest way to achieve this is by setting
   the summa.control.client.basepath property on the control server.
   This is useful if one wants to completely separate the client and
   service data from the control/repo/bundle data.

 * Bugfix: Made MoreLikeThis case sensitive for results but kept it
           case-insensitive for query. This closes bug #1659

 * Bugfix: Under certaing circumstances an empty Tag could be added in the
           facetting system

 * Bugfix: In FilterService fix possible NPE in stop() if the
           internal FilterControl fails to instantiate

 * Bugfix: The FacetBrowser did not sort Tags correctly for facets
           with one field or with less tags than the requested maximum

 * Buildfix: Enable compilation of the Web module in the global .jar target

 * Bugfix: The LuceneSearchNode returned one hit more than requested

 * Bugfix: Don't set the state to 'running' when the StorageService
           has completed statup, but use the 'idle' state (as everything
           else also does) instead

=======================
2009-05-11: Summa 1.4.3
=======================

 * Introduced a DescriptorManipulator that ensures that a copy of the
   IndexDescriptor-XML is stored in the index-folder (SB)

 * Make the search nodes (notably LuceneSearchNode and FacetSearchNode)
   capable of fetching IndexDescriptor from the index-folder. This is used
   in conjuction with the indexer copying the index descriptor over to the
   index folder on commit and consolidates.
   With this in place the searcher should be able to react on changing index
   descriptors without restarting the searcher (SB)

 * Sort commands alphabetically when listing commands inside a shell (SB)

 * Add a 'stop' command to the control-shell which can be used to stop
   a client instance (SB)

 * Factor out a ClientConnectionFactory that can be used to instantiate
   ClientConnections via a ControlConnection (SB)

 * Bring back field based sorting of search results. This is just a prelimary
   of what will come. Correct collator based sorting is not supported yet, but
   is slated for Summa 1.4.4. On the very long run we are designing a highly
   optimized sorting mechanism based on the facetting framework (SB)

 * You can now prepend queries with a boost() parameter to control query time
   boosting. The format i boost(<<field|group>^<float>> [...]). Fx boosting
   all hits in the 'ti' group by 0.1 and all hits in the 'au' field by 10:
   boost(ti^0.1 au^10) (SB)

 * You can now prefix queries with '<:explain:>' and the response from the
   search engine will contain the details of the ranking calculation. This
   is very handy for tweaking the ranking algorith by adjusting boosts in the
   IndexDescriptor or in-query (Refind)

 * Strip boosts from the documents in the legacy XSLT, they where not applied
   correctly (SB)

 * Bugfix: The wrong initializer for SummaQueryParser was used, so
	       it was not possible to specify query time boosts (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly unexport remote interfaces when we kill a Client
	       with the 'kill' command from the client-shell. Not doing this
	       caused some wierd RMI hangs and "connection refused" messages (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly shut doen client and any services when Client
           receives a stop() command (SB)

 * Bugfix: Properly detect if someone wipes the bundle repo under a
           running ControlCore (SB)

 * Bugfix: Throw a NoRouteToHostException if the StorageWrietClient can not
	       connect to the storage (SB)

 * Bugfix: Better error handling on malformed port definitions in
           SSHDeployer (SB)

 * Experimental: The JStorage configuration backend is still experimental,
                 but has received some love and is well on its way for
                 production readyness (SB)

=======================
2009-05-05: Summa 1.4.2
=======================

 * Move all facet configuration inside the index descriptor. This massively
   simplifies the configuration of the actual searcher and indexer services (SB)

 * Autostart the suggest service with the all.sh script in Summix (SB)

 * The SummaSearcher and the IndexController accept index-descriptor
   setup in the configuration root, copying the setup to search nodes
   and index manipulators (SB)

 * Use JLine to enable inline editing in the shells (client and control). This
   also bring history navigation and editing (SB)

 * Implement a fire-once filter; ClearBaseFilter, that clears a given set of
   bases the first time it receives a payload (SB)

 * Rework the starting/stopping/monitoring code in the client and control
   shells which should give mucg more usable feedback now, as well as not
   swallowing the terminal's prompt after some commands complete (SB)

 * Add Windows variant of the suggest-tool in Summix (Refind)

 * Add an --upgrade switch to the deploy command in the client-shell (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't allw starting of clients that are already running (fixed both
           control-shell and in the ControlCore itself) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Client could get stuck in an infinite loop when removing
           a service with the same instanceid for the second time (SB)

 * Bugfix: Don't crash the ControlCore if it fails to parse client configs
           at startup (SB)

 * Bugfix: Whereever URL.getFile() was used, the code did not work
           when using paths with non-trivial characters, such as
           space and # (SB)

 * Experimental: Add a JStorage backend to the configuration system, reading
                 the config data from a Javascript file (SB)

=======================
2009-04-28: Summa 1.4.1
=======================

 * Make FilterService exit the JVM when underlying FilterControl stops.
   This behaviour can be tweaked via the property
   summa.control.service.exitwithfilter (SB)
 
 * Alphabetic sorting of bundles in the commands in control-shell and
   client-shell (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Make StorageService and SearchService able to restart cleanly (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Clean up messages from StatusMonitor reporting connectionIds
           of null (SB)

 * Bugfix: The WebServices did not work when the WAR-file contained
           a '#' (used to make URLs with slashes in tomcat) (SB)

 * Bugfix: Allow overriding configuration path in the Summix suggest-tool (SB)
 
 * Bugfix: Fix process.log in Summix (Refind)


=======================
2009-04-24: Summa 1.4.0
=======================

 * Implement a Suggestion engine. For an example on how to use it see the
   Summix README. You will also find a suggest-tool.sh in Summix (SB)

 * Implement a MoreLikeThis service. It runs by default when using a
   LuceneSearchNode (SB)

 * Add a summa-support-api.jar file to the distribution (SB)

 * Much improved Windows scripts in Summix (SB)

 * Removed all usages of of the olde XmlOperations class from the Web module
   and use SBUtils xml handling throughout (SB)

 * In the Control module rename the concept of "client meta files"
   to "client control files". Control files are found in the client dir
   as control.xml. This means that there no longer is a
   ~/summa-control/meta directory (SB)

 * Add a command, 'control', on the control shell to inspect the
   deployment metadata of a deployed client (SB)

 * Added -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost to the Summix JVM invocation
   to avoid problems with firewalls and routing outside of the local computer
   (Refind)

 * Add a 'restart' command to the client shell (SB)

 * SummaSearcherImpl now supports using a static, non-monitored, index-root (SB)

 * Bugfix: The Facet building failed due to missing implementation
           of adjustPositions in the CoreMapBuilder (SB)

 * Bugfix: Allow surrounding whitespace in ints, longs, and booleans
           in configuration files (SB)

 * Bugfix: Make search-tool.sh detect its configuration properly (SB)

 * Bugfix: Spurious reporting of connections called 'null' in client- and
           control shells (SB)


=======================
2009-04-20: Summa 1.3.3
=======================

 * Fix infinite loop on empty tags introduced by a recent change in
   LuceneFacetBuilder (SB)

=======================
2009-04-20: Summa 1.3.2
=======================

 * Some tweaks to the commands in control-shell (SB):

   - 'repo' no longer requires a -l to work, -l is the default

   - 'deploy' defaults to to target host 'localhost' and now displays a better
     help message

   - Prettify some status codes in the 'clients -s' and 'status' comamnds

 * Don't default to setting summa.configuration=configuration.xml in the
   'start' command of the client shell. Just allow
   Configuration.getSystemConfiguration() in the service Launcher class
   to autodetect the config if the system property summa.configuration is unset.
   This allows for setting summa.configuration in places like
   bundles specs (service.xml and client.xml) and other useful stuff (SB)

 * The LuceneFacetBuilder did not discard empty Tags, which it does now (Refind)

 * The Windows commands search-tool.bat and storage-tool.bar in Samples/Summix
   now supports an arbitrary number of arguments (Refind)

 * The storage-tool.sh and search-tool.sh scripts from the Control module
   are now runnable from everywhere (SB)

 * When clicking a record in the demo website you now get the raw record
   contents dumped. This way the website can display all kinds of records even
   though no presentation XSLTs are provided (SB)

 * Include .war files from the Web module in Summix (SB)

 * Bugfix: When non-existing nested folders were stated in the
	       DumpFilter, it did not create the folders (SB)

 * Bugfix: Some folder structures triggered skipping of valid files
           in the FileReader (SB)


=======================
2009-04-16: Summa 1.3.1
=======================

 NOTE: Since Summa has now attracted third party contributors we will, starting
       from Summa 1.3.1, postfix each news entry with an attribution to the
       responsible party/parties enclosed in braces.

 * Add a MoreLikeThis capability to the LuceneSearchNode and a web service
   interface for this on the search web service (SB)

 * Allow web services in the Web module to fetch their configurations from
   outside the .war file, by using some JNDI-fu (SB)

 * Add a ScriptFilter that runs a Payload through any script engine supported
   by the JVM (such as Javascript). The script can be fetched externally or
   inlined in the configuration (SB)

 * Added DumpFilter which dumps Payloads into a designated folder. Used
   primarily for debugging (Refind)

 * The usual round of logging clarifications (SB, Refind)

 * Include a Samples module which as a start contains a very simple Summa
   setup called Summix. Summix does not depend on the Control framework used
   by Summa (think, bundles and services) and is mostly designed as a stand
   alone search engine for people without huge scalability needs. Summix
   also runs on Windows. (Refind)

 * Bump SBUtil from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4. This brings in new features in
   ReplaceFactory we need in order to optimize query analysis (SB)

 * Consolidation of the Lucene analyzers in the Common module. This means
   dropping TokenReplaceFilter, TransliteratingReader, StringReplaceReader,
   and TransliterionFilter from the source tree. All the replacement is now done
   entirely inside the ReplaceReaders from SBUtil. This brings a hefty
   optimization to query parser performance (at least a factor of 20) (SB)

 * Configurations can now escpae system properties inside integer, long, and
   boolean values. It only did strings before (SB)

 * Bugfix: Explicitly remove log4j.xml from the summa-common.jar

 * Bugfix: Add a 'process' appender to the log4j configuration in the
           sample bundles. Output goes to log/process.log (SB)

 * Bugfix: The AbstractDiscardFilter has its logic reversed so that
	       only Payloads that were judged discardable was preserved and vise
	       versa (Refind)

=======================
2009-03-27: Summa 1.3.0
=======================

 * IMPORTANT: The DerbyStorage and PostgresStorage backends are not functional
   in Summa 1.3.0. It is planned to fix them in later micro versions of the
   Summa 1.3 series

 * Make H2Storage the default storage backend

 * The 'data' column in H2Storage has been changed from type BLOB to type BYTEA.
   We know it is bad style to break the DB schemas but with type BLOB H2
   dumps _lots_ of small files with the content data. With BYTEA the data is
   inlined in the db resulting in a static number of 5 files for the db

 * Make DatabaseStorage use SQL transactions. While fixing some race conditions
   this also gives a huge performance boost on flush() and flushAll().
   This affects both H2Storage, DerbyStorage, and PostgresStorage

 * In the config for H2Storahe you now only specify the root folder of the db,
   not the root folder+fileprefix. The file prefix is always summa_h2storage

 * Bump H2 library to 1.1.109. This fixes a gradual performance degradation on
   H2Storage when inserting millions of records

 * Bump SBUtil dep. to 0.4.3

 * Rewrite of the core analyzers to use SBUtil 0.4.3. This brings a considerable
   performance booost to indexing speed

 * Use XSLT handling from SBUtil 0.4.3. This also means that XML transformations
   can now optionally ignore namespaces

 * Add runnable classes for launching the core Summa components without needing
   the entire Control framework. The following classes now has main methods
   detecting their config via the system prop. summa.configuration:
   FilterControl, SummaSearcherRunner, and StorageRunner

 * Optimize building of the facet structure by introducing an internal cache,
   and by avoiding some memory allocations inside loops

 * Change sorting strategy for disk based facets to use merge-sort
   instead of heap-sort. This results in a lot less disk IO and coupled
   with a cache for persistent values, this speeds up the sort after dirty
   adds tremendously

 * Changed FileReader to resolve files lazily. Before this change it build
   a full list of all files before starting. This took a considerable amount of
   time if the data dir contained hundred of thousands of files

 * Changed the default queue-size and sleep-time for ThreadedStreamParser as
   the old defaults resulted in poor performance

 * Tweak the default sizes of the PayloadQueues in MUXFilterFeeder
   to 100 Payloads instead of 1 (the memory-limit default is 1MByte). This may
   give a performance boost on some setups depending on MUXFilters

 * Introduce two new field types; 'verbatim' and 'storedVerbatim' which will
   index the field contents as one unaltered token (with casing and diacritics),
   but keep it searchable. In contrast the field types 'keyword' and
   'storedKeyword' are case insensitive and removes non-alphanumeric symbols,
   but also indexing the content as a single token

 * Better handling of failures in the ingest- and index chains by introducing
   a PayloadException and return codes from ObjectFilterImpl.processPayload()

 * Add an explicit log to follow record/payload lifetimes

 * Bugfix: The ServiceObj (responsible for handling SOAP-requests) failed
           randomly on multi-threading

 * Bugfix: Merging of DocumentResponses did not update the total
	       number of hits

 * Bugfix: The TagHandler didn't perform dirty adds when asked to do so

 * Bugfix: The FacetSearchNode did not open the TagHandlers in read-only mode

 * Bugfix: Fix handling of quoted arguments to search-tool. This makes it
           possible to do phrase searches with the search-tool

 * Bugfix: The AbstractDiscardFilter (and its subclasses) wasn't
	       actually ObjectFilters, they just had all the methods

 * Bugfix: Made the FileReader auto-close delivered Streams when they reach
           EOF. This guards against file handle starvation

 * Bugfix: The IndexDescriptor class checked for changed descriptors
           all the time when the check-interval was 0. The correct behaviour
           is not to check when the interval is 0

 * Bugfix: Fix compliance to ReadableStorage contract in StorageReaderClient -
           to throw a NoSuchElementException when the iter is depleted in
           next(iterKey) and next(iterKey, maxRecords)

 * Bugfix: AggregatingStorage did not support base=null in
           getModificationTime() and getRecordsModifiedAfter()

 * Bugfix: The FileReader had a race-condition for closing and
           renaming files that was triggered by the FileWatchers
           multi-threaded usage of FileReader

 * Bugfix: FilterService, FilterControl, and FilterPump will now properly
           shut down and wait for all payloads to be processed before
           shutting down when invoking close()/stop() on them

 * Bugfix: The MarcMultiVolumeMerger is now more forgiving if the records does
           not declare their type correctly

 * Bugfix: Fix deadlock when closing down a RecordReader with a StorageWatcher

 * Bugfix: Bugfix: queue.offer was used by FacetSearchNode and DocIDCollector
           without check for success. This has been changed to put with a
           retry in case of interruptions

=======================
2009-02-18: Summa 1.2.1
=======================

 * Add options to RecordReader for deciding whether or not to request
   parent/child expansion when receiving records

 * You can now specify the port used by the SSHDeployer. This means that you can
   now do stuff like 'deploy foo-client-1 c1 localhost:220' in the control-shell
   if your sshd run on port 220 instead opf 22

 * Add a new class RecordUtil in the Common module that can serialize
   Record objects to and from XML efficiently. There's also an XML schema for
   this XML format. Record contents will be XML escaped and any parent/child
   records will be embedded in the XML

 * Add a DelayFilter to facilitate throttling of filter chains (fx. if the
   index process eats up to much cpu)

 * Added a DiscardUpdatesFilter that discards records with ids that has
   already passed it. That is it prevents any updates being done on an index
   or storage consuming the filter chain

 * Added a DiscardRelativesFilter that discards records based on their
   relatives. This can fx. be used to discard all records that has any parents
   from the filter chain

 * Added a reverse-sort option to FileReader, making it possible to iterate over
   found files in reverse unicode order
   
 * Bugfix: Assigning the same source multiple times to MUXFilter resulted in
   the last Payloads of a stream of Payloads being skipped under certain
   race-conditions

 * Bugfix: The round-robin used by the MUXFilter always selected the first
   available filter

 * Bugfix: Record did not clear the list of parents when setParentID was set

 * Way too many test cases and bug fixes to list here. Seriously.

=======================
2009-02-09: Summa 1.2.0
=======================
 
 * Add a new mode to the FacetManipulator doing blazingly fast batch updates.
   This strategy will be used by default when doing consolidates
 
 * Add an optional skipupdates property to the facet builder, making it
   possible to postpone facet building until commit or consolidate
 
 * Implement a SummaSearcherAggregator facilitating distributed searches
 
 * More intuitive and fail safe configuration of filters by using lists of
   subconfigurations rather than using named subconfigurations and refering to
   them by their names
 
 * Massive speed update(s) in the indexer
   
   - Implement a streaming Lucene document creator instead of
     the old DOM based one
   
   - Use thread local caches in our Analyzers to minimize garbage collection of
     object instantiations
   
   - Fix big bottle neck where we parsed the transliteration rules one time
     for each field in each document!
   
   - Also use thread local caches in our XSLT plugins and make sure we do a
     minimum of string replacements
 
 * Records use lazy gzip compression/decompression of contents to minimize
   network overhead
 
 * Make MARC multi volume handling work both on the storage level and on the
   ingest level
 
 * Improve update rules for the RecordReader filter
 
 * Improve time granularity in the RecordReader to milliseconds (was seconds)

 * Fix bug where we leaked abandoned iterators in the DatabaseStorage

 * Major overhaul of the Storage API:
   
   - Remove getRecordsFrom()
          
   - Remove getRecordsFromBase()
          
   - Add a QueryOptions parameter to all ReadableStorage methods. This
     new parameter is used to control parent/child expansion as well
     as whether to retrieve deleted/indexable records
   
   - Always sort result sets by mtime
 
 * New backends for the database storage as Derby seems to have some problematic
   performance issues:
   
    - PostgresQL
    
    - H2 (the new default)
 
 * Other updates on the database Storage implementations
 
   - Proper connection- and statement pooling on all database Storage backends
   
   - All mtime timestamps are now globally uniqye withing the storage.
     To go finer than the millisecond granularity provided by the Java system
     timestamps (System.nanoSeconds() is not applicable here) we use a salted
     timestamp packed in a long
   
   - Two "modes" for the backend implementations of DatabaseStorage are
     supported (the new H2Storage applies both these modes)
     
       o Paging - meaning that only small result sets are queried at a time
       
       o Lazy relation lookups, not doing JOINs on the DB, but looking relations
         up when needed
    
   - Added query timings to storage-tool and added a 'dump' command as well
     to do a raw dump of the entire storage or a single base
 
 * Bump internal version of libraries:
 
   - Lucene 2.3.0 -> 2.4.0
   
   - Derby 10.3.1.4 -> 10.4.2.0

 * Add support for the URLRepository class to list repository contents via
   a bundles.list file on the server

 * Create a generic Record generator for use in test scenarios. It can can
   create records with random content based on a configurable criteria

 * Configuration files can now escape system properties enclosed in
   Ant style brackets. Eg. "${user.home}/summa-database"

 * Bundle specs can now contain zero to many <jvmArg> tags that will be added
   verbatim to the command line for the bundle when it is launched

 * Added a bunch of tests cases covering all the metadata formats employed at
   the State and University Library

 * Introduce summa-bundletool, a command line helper tool used to create and
   validate bundles

 * Optimize the commiting of records to the storage

 * XML Schema for the Summa Document format used by the indexer

 * XML Schema for the Summa index descriptor format

 * Implement a Workflow module that can execute a generic "workflow" based
   on an XML file. This can be used to implement daemons that reset bases,
   downloads data dumps, starts indexing processes and what not.

 * Fix some tricky namespacing bugs in XMLSplitter

 * Remove hard RMI dependency from shell tools, they now use a generic RPC
   mechanism to talk to the servers

 * The control-shell and client-shell command line tools are now fully
   scriptable. Supplying exatr commands when launching them will also make
   them run the commands and exit. For more info try the 'help exec' command
   added to these tools

 * Lots of work on making the debugging messages in the log files more helpful

 * Make unit tests independent of hardcoded paths such as /tmp

 * Write a tool (doc/summa-doc-tool) that extracts property definitions and
   their documentation from the Java source files. Result can be seen on the
   wiki at: http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Properties

 * Implement a FilterSequence, a filter that runs through a series of
   child filters

 * Implement a MUXFilter that can mux payloads/records between different
   child-filters based on the record base of the payload

 * Log profiling/statistics information in Filter framework
 
 * Proper retraction of MBeans and remote interfaces when closing a service

 * Solved bug that made the IndexController commit for each Record
 
 * Tonnes of bug fixes


=======================
2008-10-31: Summa 1.1.0
=======================

The Summa team is proud to announce the immediate availability of Summa 1.1.

A ton of work has gone into this new release and we are very are confident that
it will pave the way for an interesting time for library search egnines.

With this release Summa has reached a point where it is on feature parity
(but a lot more powerful) than the old Summa we run in production on out
main site statsbiblioteket.dk.

If you are interested in the future development of Summa take a look at
http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Community/RoadMap which already contains
the roadmap for 1.2 and beyond.

The release code be downloaded in binary or source form from

  http://wiki.statsbiblioteket.dk/summa/Community/Download

It can also be check out from a dedicated SVN tag:

  svn co https://gforge.statsbiblioteket.dk/svn/summa/tags/summa-1.1.0

Here follows a summary of development that has gone into Summa 1.1:

New Features:

 * The whole workflow from ingest, indexation, to facet computation is now
   fully incremental

 * MARC and Aleph handling code has been updated to work with the new
   filter-based ingest model

 * Autostart of Clients and Services. This is currently only enabled in the
   test-client-1 and test-storage-1 bundles

 * Add a method for removing deployed services from a client

 * Introduce a new Workflow module that can execute workflows specified
   in an XML format. At SB we will use this handle special cases where some
   data sources needs to be reset each time updates arrive

 * Add StorageWatcher class that can monitor a storage instance for changes
   to certain bases

 * The Storage API has seen a major overhaul. The old one leake implementation
   details and where not properly extensible by third parties without accessing
   some Summa internals. The new API is void of implementation details can be
   properly extended

 * Implement an AggregatingStorage that aggregates multiple sub-storage
   instances (in a distributed environment) an exposes them as a single
   storage instance

 * Record data is now passes compressed over the wire an uncompressed lazily

 * The DatabaseStorage class now implements parent-child relationsships for
   records (which means that the default storage, DerbyStorage, will too).
   This is used for multi-volume handling and in the future FRBR


Misc:

 * Web service .war files now contain build information (Summa version number)

 * Removed deprecated and outdated code and config files. You can find the old
   code in the attic/ subdirectory in each module

 * storage-tool.sh now supports an 'xslt' switch that can apply an xslt to a
   given record

 * Add 'spec' command to client shell that can display the bundle spec for the
   client or a given service

 * Add 'remove' command to client shell that can remove a deployed service from
   the client

Bugs Fixed:

 * Time stamp granularity in Storage was 1s. The new granularity is 1ms

 * Fixes to 'distclean' targets in a few modules (to do proper build cleanup)

 * Updated base modification time in WriatbleStorage.clearBase()

 * The Client only listed the services deployed during its current JVM session,
   it now lists all services deployed

 * Certain cases where a missing secutiry manager would mess up RMI

 * Lots and lots of lower profile bugs


=======================
2008-09-15: Summa 1.0.0
=======================

 * Minor bug fixes

 * Tweaks to configurations of example bundles

 * Test website displays a message when no facets are found

=======================
2008-09-12: Summa 0.9
=======================

 * Add webservices for Search and Storage

 * Add a small test website

 * Enable facet generation by default

 * Tons of bug fixes

 * Major rename of all configuration properties to used a consistent naming scheme

=======================
2008-09-02: Summa 0.8
=======================

This marks the first milestone towards the stable open source release of Summa.

It is important to note that this is not a stable, or anywhere near production,
release. It is a development snapshot made when we reached a collection of
internally set goals.

The feature set of this release is not much more than what you will find on the
tutorial page at :
