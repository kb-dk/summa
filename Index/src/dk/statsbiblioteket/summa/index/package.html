    Indexing takes place using the Filter Framework defined in Summa Commons.
    As such there are no hard requirements on how it is handled, but the
    typical path is as follows:
</p><p>
    A Storage RecordReader starts the chain by pumping Records from a Storage.
    The Record is passed through a chain of filters that are modifies the
    content or adds meta-data. One example would be the addition of the current
    status of availability for a book.
    The Record content is transformed from source-specific XML to
    SummaDocumentXML by the filter CreateSummaDocumentXML.
    The SummaDocumentXML is transformed to a Lucene Document by the filter
    CreateDocument.
    The Lucene Document is added to an existing index by the filter
    IndexController.
</p><p>
    In case of very rapidly changing meta-data, such as availability for books,
    an alternative path could be:
</p><p>
    1. Storage1 => CreateSummaDocumentXML => Storage2.
    2. Storage2 => EnrichWithAvailability => CreateDocument => IndexController.
    Where step 1 is performed when new books arrive and step 2 is performed
    upon changed in availability status.
</p><p>
    Since a hook to availability data from an external system could modify the
    meta-data for a given Record in Storage2 by itself, step 2 could simply be:
</p><p>
    2. Storage2 => CreateDocument => IndexController.
