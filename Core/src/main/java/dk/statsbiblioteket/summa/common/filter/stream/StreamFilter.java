/**
 * On an abstract level, ingesting is just a chain of filters. In the beginning
 * of the chain is a filter that extracts raw data from a source (such as XML
 * files on the local file system), then follows chains that transforms,
 * ingests and index the data. Normally the chain will consist of StreamFilters
 * followed by {@link ObjectFilter}s, but that is not a requirement.
 * </p><p>
 * The format for the top-level datastream is as follows:<br />
 * {@code
 * STREAM: (HEAD BODY)*EOF
 * HEAD: ID-Size(long) ID(Size bytes of ID-String in utf-8)
 * BODY: Content-Size(long) Content(Size bytes)
 * EOF: -1, as used in the standard InputStream.
 * }
 * </p><p>
 * An example of use could be a file loader that scans for multiple files,
 * reads the content sequentially and sends a stream made up of a body for
 * each file read. If the length of the content is unknown at load-time,
 * the filter must state Long.MAX_VALUE as the length. Readers must then
 * continue to read content until EOF is reached after which the filter is
 * considered depleted.
 * </p><p>
 * If EOF is reached and a read is performed, the implementation must continue
 * to return EOF.
 * </p><p>
 * An overall principle for filters is that they should only fail in case of
 * catastrophic events, such as out of memory. If the input is not as expected,
 * the filter should skip corrupt input (with appropriate logging of errors)
 * and attempt to continue processing further data.
 * @deprecated {@link ObjectFilter} has been extended to handle streams and
 *             provides a more flexible interface.
