/**
 * Encapsulation of a scripted batch job run on a subset of the storage.
 * <p/>
 * Any {@link ScriptEngine} supported by the JVM can be used as a scripting
 * backend. See
 * <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">scripting.dev.java.net</a> for a
 * full list of scripting engines for the Java platform.
 * <p/>
 * The script environment will have a number of variables loaded on
 * execution time. These are
 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>record</tt> - The {@link Record} object to operate on</li>
 * <li><tt>log</tt> - A Commons-Logging {@link Log} object</li>
 * <li><tt>base</tt> - The name of the base being operated on - possibly {@code null} when iterating over all bases</li>
 * <li><tt>minMtime</tt> - The minimum modification time for the records in the batch</li>
 * <li><tt>maxMtime</tt> - The maximum modification time for the records in the batch</li>
 * <li><tt>options</tt> - A {@link QueryOptions} instance</li>
 * <li><tt>state</tt> - A private variable to be used by the script to hold arbitrary state in between invocations.
 *                      This variable is initialized to {@code null} by the runtime</li>
 * <li><tt>out</tt> - A {@link PrintWriter} collecting any output to return from the script. Notably methods
 *                    {@code out.print()} and {@code out.println()} are available</li>
 *  <li><tt>commit</tt> - A boolean flag that must be set to {@code true} if the script wants to commit any changes it
 *    has done to {@code record}. This variable will be set to {@code false} prior to each evaluation of the script</li>
 * <li><tt>first</tt> - A boolean flag which is {@code true} on the first invocation of the script.
 *                      Always {@code false} otherwise</li>
 * <li><tt>last</tt> - A boolean flag which is {@code true} when the last record in the batch is reached.
 *                     Always {@code false} otherwise</li>
 * </ul>
