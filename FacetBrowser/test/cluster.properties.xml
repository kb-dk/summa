    <!-- The tag handler is responsible to translate the internal references to
         tag names. Valid values are
         MemoryTagHandler: Loads all tagnames in memory. Fast, but requires
                           a lot of memory (ca. ½ GB / million documents).
         DiskTagHandler:   Performs lookup on disk. Relies on disk-cache for
                           quick response-time. Worst-case (if no tags names are
                           cached) is about 1 extra second.
                           It requires 8 * the number of tags bytes in RAM.
                           The number of tags is (_very_ roughly) 4-5 million /
                           1 million documents.
                           Note that indexes for the tag names needs to be build
                           each time the taglists have changed. This is done
                           automatically and tages about 2 minutes / 1 million
